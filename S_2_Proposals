---> Proposal 920,953 [letter to politicians]

Draft a one page letter that can be sent by Canadians to their respective member of parliament that brings attention to the problem of currency inflation

"Dear X, 

As a citizen in your riding, I'm deeply concerned about currency inflation and hope you will advocate for ending the debasement of my time via currency inflation.

After recently learning the truth about inflation, I'm angry that my time is being devalued by our government and hope you will address the injustice.

By inflating the supply of currency, the government creates a perverse incentive to spend excessively and erode the purchasing power of it's citizens, making life harder for everyone.

As a concerned citizen, i'm asking you to read the policy proposal for Canada's return to a commodity backed dollar found here: [link]

......."

NOTES:
- Landing page, remailer to make it super easy
- The more point and click
- Worthwhile to have a second letter that shows advantanges for politicians that got behind bitcoin, tap into their green and desire to get involved
- Trump as an example
- Pierre got bad advice to stay away from canada
- Canadian data about bitcoiners in Canada
- Data on Canadian Bitcoiners
