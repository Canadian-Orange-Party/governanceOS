RAW NOTES/IDEAS

Mission: recruit warriors to stand against politcial oppression and theft by currency inflation

Assemble a legal team and create non profit organization?

Canadians who acquire and custody bitcoin are permissionlessly gaining socioeconomic influence. Real power. Permissionlessly replacing the abstract power of politicians. Not a negotiation but an imposition of reality to replace fake, abstract power that is being abused

WE THE PEOPLE know and assert our fundamental rights and freedoms

We do not acknowledge the legitimacy of politics which have been corrupted by criminals

Guardian updates: sent from CENTCOM via emails using encrypted email

Sign up for email list by sending email which includes npub, replying guardian to DM

OP website: include letter, essay, guardians vow and path to take vow and get verified 

Under a sound money paradigm, guardians (those who control bitcoin and take the Guardians vow) permissionless replace politicians

Rule by the people. Delete politics, delete beaurocracy. Restore civic duty and personal reposnibility

A system to replace politics with sound governance

Rebuild broken, corrupt governance systems on sound money

Full time Guardians begin at $77,000/year (salary of average firefighter in Canada). No indexing required when inflation ends. 5% increase in pay every 2 years to maximum of $150,000. Mission/danger pay rate TBD

Mission to free Canadians from political tyranny by removing the ability to inflate currency from the control of criminals posing at politicians

Know your legal and natural rights. Know the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms

Recruit police, military, fire, paramedics, leaders of families, leaders of business organizations

Maintain privacy, operate privately. Those who know, know. Do not boast. Grow numbers of verified guardians, make the number dynamically updated on the cyber domain
