Welcome to the fifth meeting for the Canadian Orange Party

My call sign is Spear, orange ID CO_919953. I'm honoured to be moderating this session

Current block height is X and 1 canadian dollar currently buys you  sats

Thank you all for attending live or reading this meeting transcript in future



A few housekeeping items to begin with:


1. This meeting is being recorded

The audio will eventually be transcribed and made public online in the repository

For privacy and security reasons, please do not use your real name during meetings

Before you speak, please identify yourself with your call sign 

Remaining pseudonymous may seem extreme but we feel it’s critical for our individual privacy and safety

The fiat powers know no limits for how far they will go to silence truth or threats to its powers

It’s up to us to maintain privacy to protect ourselves long term.


2. Please keep your mic muted until you are ready to speak to reduce background noise

4. This meeting will be max 60 minutes, shorter if we finish early



Agenda:
- Updates (library, podcast, pamphlet ready to distribute)
- Canadian National Guard (introduce concept, Essay, WE THE PEOPLE letter)
- Governance: B7 discussion
- Closing



UPDATES

- Library is online in the repo. Protocol we're starting: a resource goes from mempool to library once 2 contributors approve it. Must contribute a resource to the mempool to become a contributor, voting happens every meeting
- New podcast episodes have been recorded, episode about how sound money changes home ownership in Canada is worth a listen for anyone aspiring towards home ownership
- v1.0 of the education pamphlet is ready for print and distribution. Is anyone familiar with a tool to host PDF's online?

CNG

- Concept: Assemble a decentralized citizen reserve force that accept the responsibility to educate their communities and advocate for truth (money, health, governance)
- Members are called Guardians, eventually replace politicians when we move beyond fiat politics into sound governance by the people for the people
- CanadianNationalGuard.com is currently being worked up and should be live within 48hrs. Will host a short 2 page essay and a letter to Canadians
- Objective: unify Canadians with shared values, coordinate to help during the upcoming storm that is fast approaching

GOVERNANCE DISCUSSION

- 











Updates: 
- Resource library created in repo. Build out a web library to help people navigate the money/economics/energy/psychology rabbit hole
- Pamphlet v1.0 finalized. Symptom facilitated first print batch of 121 
- Decentralized, coordinated printing. Personalized note on each package

- News: UK attempting to ban "cryptocurrency" (digital assets) donations in politics
- Watching this closely, will also come to Canada if it succeeds
- Claim: opacity, potential for foreign actors to interfere with UK elections, micro donations are not traceable
- Irony: only the money they control can be used to support politicians. Absurd
- Attempt: ban of digital asset donations
- Insight: they are scared. They know what's coming. Orange politicians will dominate. Nigel Farage is the source of the ban
