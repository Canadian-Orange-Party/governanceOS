UPDATES

- Library is online in the repo. Protocol we're starting: a resource goes from mempool to library once 2 contributors approve it. Must contribute a resource to the mempool to become a contributor, voting happens every meeting
- New podcast episodes have been recorded, episode about how sound money changes home ownership in Canada is worth a listen for anyone aspiring towards home ownership
- v1.0 of the education pamphlet is ready for print and distribution. Is anyone familiar with a tool to host PDF's online?

CNG

- Concept: Assemble a decentralized citizen reserve force that accept the responsibility to educate their communities and advocate for truth (money, health, governance)
- Members are called Guardians, eventually replace politicians when we move beyond fiat politics into sound governance by the people for the people
- CanadianNationalGuard.com is currently being worked up and should be live within 48hrs. Will host a short 2 page essay and a letter to Canadians
- Objective: unify Canadians with shared values, coordinate to help during the upcoming storm that is fast approaching

GOVERNANCE DISCUSSION

- 











Updates: 
- Resource library created in repo. Build out a web library to help people navigate the money/economics/energy/psychology rabbit hole
- Pamphlet v1.0 finalized. Symptom facilitated first print batch of 121 
- Decentralized, coordinated printing. Personalized note on each package

- News: UK attempting to ban "cryptocurrency" (digital assets) donations in politics
- Watching this closely, will also come to Canada if it succeeds
- Claim: opacity, potential for foreign actors to interfere with UK elections, micro donations are not traceable
- Irony: only the money they control can be used to support politicians. Absurd
- Attempt: ban of digital asset donations
- Insight: they are scared. They know what's coming. Orange politicians will dominate. Nigel Farage is the source of the ban
