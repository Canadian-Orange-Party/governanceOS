- Pamphlet v1.0 finalized. Symptom facilitated first print batch of 121

- News: UK attempting to ban "cryptocurrency" (digital assets) donations in politics
- Watching this closely, will also come to Canada if it succeeds
- Claim: opacity, potential for foreign actors to interfere with UK elections, micro donations are not traceable
- Irony: only the money they control can be used to support politicians. Absurd
- Attempt: ban of digital asset donations
- Insight: they are scared. They know what's coming. Orange politicians will dominate. Nigel Farage is the source of the ban
