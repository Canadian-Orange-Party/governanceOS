DRAFT 0.8


--> Front Cover (panel 6):

INFLATION IS THEFT!

Is your hard-earned money disappearing? 

Every year, inflation quietly steals from your savings, wages, and future—eroding your purchasing power without you even noticing

In Canada, it's not just rising prices; it's a hidden tax imposed by endless money printing

Turn the page to uncover the truth and fight back

Title page:

INFLATION IS THEFT

41% gone in 5 years

THE BANK OF CANADA IS PRINTING YOUR FUTURE INTO OBLIVION

Visual: A shredded $100 bill bleeding red ink into a black void. The maple leaf on the bil;l is cracked and fading.

Bold white text on blood red background: botton corner says "turn inside - see the proof, stop the crime."

--> Inside Spread (panels 1,2,3): 

The Truth About Currency Inflation

Inflation isn't "Rising Costs" — It's Currency Debasement

Imagine working overtime to buy groceries, only to find your dollar buys less each month

That's inflation: the government and central banks creating money out of thin air, flooding the economy with new dollars while your supply stays the same

This dilutes the value of every dollar you hold—like adding water to your soup until it's tasteless

It's not accidental. The Bank of Canada prints trillions to fund deficits and bailouts, but the cost falls on *you*: higher prices for rent, food, and fuel

This "currency inflation" robs savers, punishes families, and widens inequality—transferring wealth from the working class to banks and insiders 


**The Shocking Data: CAD M2 Money Supply Explosion (2020–2025)**  

M2 measures the broad money supply (cash, checking accounts, and easy-to-access savings)

Here's how it ballooned under pandemic-era printing, fueling the inflation crisis:  

| Year | Year-over-Year Growth 
------|------------------------- 
| End 2020 | +10.5% 
| End 2021 | +21%   
| End 2022 | +8.7% 
| End 2023 | +4% 
| End 2024 | +3.5% 

*Source: Bank of Canada data via CEIC and Trading Economics.*  

Result? Cumulative M2 growth of **~41%** in just 5 years—far outpacing wage growth (avg. 3–4%/year)

Your dollars have lost 25–30% of their value since 2020

Thats not progress; it's plunder  

Visual suggestion: A simple bar chart showing the M2 growth spike in red, contrasted with a flat green line for average wages. Add icons of shrinking grocery bags or rising price tags

The Power of Sound Money

**End Inflation: Reclaim Stability with Sound Money.**  

What if money held its value—like it did under historical gold standards? 

A "sound money" system ties currency to a fixed asset (e.g., gold, bitcoin or a commodity basket), preventing endless printing. No more debasement. Here's what Canada gains:  

Benefits of Sound Money & Ending Inflation:

- Price Stability: Everyday costs freeze—groceries, housing, and gas stop skyrocketing. Families plan with confidence.  
- Real Savings Growth: Your bank account *grows* in value, rewarding hard work instead of punishing it. Retire with dignity.  
- Fairer Economy: Ends the wealth transfer to elites. Small businesses thrive without surprise rate hikes; jobs become secure.  
- Stronger Nation: Attracts investment, curbs debt addiction, and restores trust in the loonie. No more boom-bust cycles—steady growth for all.  

Countries like Switzerland (with gold-backed policies) enjoy low inflation and high living standards. Canada can too. 

Inflation isn't inevitable; it's a policy choice. Choose sound money—choose prosperity.  

Visual suggestion: Before/after split: Chaotic storm of rising prices on left; calm, green fields with stable icons (house, piggy bank, family) on right. Gold coin emblem.

IDEAS:

"Inflation: The Silent Theft of Your Wealth"

"Tired of getting F!&*ED by inflation? Let's do something about it

"Tired of getting ripped off by inflation?" So are we. Here's what we can do about it

The government and maintream media (propaganda outlets) tell us that price inflation of 2-3% per year is normal, good and neccesary. It's a lie. Are you comfortable with 3% of your things being stolen per year? No. Theft is theft

CPI is a fraudulent number concocted by beaurocrats to make true inflation seem lower than it actually is

The cause of inflation is currency inflation. When the state inflates the currency, it devalues and steals your time

"it's not you, it's not the policicians, it's the money"

"Would you be OK with someone stealing 5% of your property per year?" Neither would we

If you see a theft, do you say something? Us too, that's why we're sending you this

End currency inflation. It's immoral, unfair and harmful
