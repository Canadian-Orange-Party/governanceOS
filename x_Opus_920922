IDEAS:

"Tired of getting F!&*ED by inflation? Help us do something about it

"Tired of getting ripped off by inflation?" So are we. Here's what we can do about it

The government and maintream media (propaganda outlets) tell us that price inflation of 2-3% per year is normal, good and neccesary. It's a lie. Are you comfortable with 3% of your things being stolen per year? No. Theft is theft

CPI is a fraudulent number concocted by beaurocrats to make true inflation seem lower than it actually is

The true driver of inflation is currency inflation. When the state inflates the currency, it devalues and steals your time

"it's not you, it's not the policicians, it's the money"

"Would you be OK with someone stealing 5% of your property per year?" Neither would we

If you see a theft, do you say something? Us too, that's why we're sending you this

End currency inflation. It's immoral, unfair and harmful

DRAFT 0.8

"Inflation: The Silent Theft of Your Wealth"


--> Front Cover (panel 1):

INFLATION IS THEFT!

Is your hard-earned money disappearing? 

Every year, inflation quietly steals from your savings, wages, and future—eroding your purchasing power without you even noticing

In Canada, it's not just rising prices; it's a hidden tax imposed by endless money printing

Turn the page to uncover the truth and fight back

--> Inside Left Panel (Panel 2): 

The Truth About Currency Inflation

Inflation isn't "Rising Costs" — It's Currency Debasement

Imagine working overtime to buy groceries, only to find your dollar buys less each month

That's inflation: the government and central banks creating money out of thin air, flooding the economy with new dollars while your supply stays the same

This dilutes the value of every dollar you hold—like adding water to your soup until it's tasteless

It's not accidental. The Bank of Canada prints trillions to fund deficits and bailouts, but the cost falls on *you*: higher prices for rent, food, and fuel

This "currency inflation" robs savers, punishes families, and widens inequality—transferring wealth from the working class to banks and insiders 


**The Shocking Data: CAD M2 Money Supply Explosion (2020–2025)**  

M2 measures the broad money supply (cash, checking accounts, and easy-to-access savings). Here's how it ballooned under pandemic-era printing, fueling the inflation crisis:  

| Year | M2 Level (CAD Billion) | Year-over-Year Growth |  
|------|-------------------------|-----------------------|  
| End 2020 | ~1,900 | +10.5% |  
| End 2021 | ~2,300 | +21% (Peak surge) |  
| End 2022 | ~2,500 | +8.7% |  
| End 2023 | ~2,600 | +4% |  
| End 2024 | ~2,690 | +3.5% |  

*Source: Bank of Canada data via CEIC and Trading Economics.*  

Result? Cumulative M2 growth of **~41%** in just 5 years—far outpacing wage growth (avg. 3–4%/year). Your dollar lost 25–30% of its value since 2020. This isn't progress; it's plunder.  

*(Visual suggestion: A simple bar chart showing the M2 growth spike in red, contrasted with a flat green line for average wages. Add icons of shrinking grocery bags or rising price tags.)*
