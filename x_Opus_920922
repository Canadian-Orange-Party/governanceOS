IDEAS:

"Tired of getting F!&*ED by inflation? Help us do something about it

"Tired of getting ripped off by inflation?" So are we. Here's what we can do about it

The government and maintream media (propaganda outlets) tell us that price inflation of 2-3% per year is normal, good and neccesary. It's a lie. Are you comfortable with 3% of your things being stolen per year? No. Theft is theft

CPI is a fraudulent number concocted by beaurocrats to make true inflation seem lower than it actually is

The true driver of inflation is currency inflation. When the state inflates the currency, it devalues and steals your time

"it's not you, it's not the policicians, it's the money"

"Would you be OK with someone stealing 5% of your property per year?" Neither would we

If you see a theft, do you say something? Us too, that's why we're sending you this

End currency inflation. It's immoral, unfair and harmful
