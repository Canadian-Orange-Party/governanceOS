STRATEGY
- Read nostr post 23:

Context: $CAD is a fraudulent currency. A deceptive tool masquerading as money, used to exploit and control citizens

Until it is abolished, and replaced by sound money, no meaningful progress can be made to fix the problems we face in Canada

Objective: Fix the money so we can begin fixing Canada

Strategy: Educate citizens and facilitate effective action

Primary tactic: Grassroots education that exposes the fraud of fiat currency and increases awareness about the importance of saving in sound money (bitcoin)

Secondary tactic: Educate politicians about the immoral and harmful nature of fiat currency & support political candidates who vow to expose fraudulent currency and advocate for a return to sound money
