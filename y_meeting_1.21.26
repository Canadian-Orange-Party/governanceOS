Welcome to the fourth meeting for the Canadian Orange Party

My call sign is Spear, orange ID CO_919953. I'm honoured to be moderating this session

Current block height is 933,244 and 1 canadian dollar currently buys you 810 sats

Thank you all for attending live or reading this meeting transcript in future



A few housekeeping items to begin with:


1. This meeting is being recorded

The audio will eventually be transcribed and made public online in the repository

For privacy and security reasons, please do not use your real name during meetings

We recommend creating a dedicated nostr keypair with your call sign for consistency

Before you speak, please identify yourself with your call sign 

Remaining pseudonymous may seem extreme but we feel it’s critical for our individual privacy and safety

The fiat powers know no limits for how far they will go to silence truth or threats to its powers

It’s up to us to maintain privacy to protect ourselves long term.


2. Please keep your mic muted until you are ready to speak to reduce background noise

3. If you wish to speak, please raise your hand and I will ask you to speak by naming your call sign

4. This meeting will be max 60 minutes, shorter if we finish early


I want to start with a quote that encapsulates the Orange mission very well:

“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, 

for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.” 

That quote is by Henry Ford


Highlights the notion that by exposing the canadian dollar as the fraudulent currency that it is, we can initiate a financial revolution
one person at a time


When enough Canadians understand the truth, opt out of fraudulent currency and commit to helping restore sound money in Canada, 
we create the possibility to see meaningful change


Agenda today:

- 5 minutes opening the call
- 5 minutes of updates
- 25 minute Strategy discussion
- 20 minute OPUS review
- 5 minute mentioning open roles and closing the call



UPDATES
- EndInflationCanada Website, first sponsor (seeking two more), secondary domain is active (SoundMoneyCanada.com), will potentially be used for a future project
- Canadian Orange podcast now has 11 episodes, inflation counterpropaganda episode is live


STRATEGY
- Read nostr post 23:

Context: $CAD is a fraudulent currency. A deceptive tool masquerading as money, used to exploit and control citizens

Until it is abolished, and replaced by sound money, no meaningful progress can be made to fix the problems we face in Canada

Objective: Fix the money so we can begin fixing Canada

Strategy: Educate citizens and facilitate effective action

Primary tactic: Grassroots education that exposes the fraud of fiat currency and increases awareness about the importance of saving in sound money (bitcoin)

Secondary tactic: Educate politicians about the immoral and harmful nature of fiat currency & support political candidates who vow to expose fraudulent currency and advocate for a return to sound money
