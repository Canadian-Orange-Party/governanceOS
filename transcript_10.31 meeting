Attendees: Spear, Noble, Weekend, Labor, Soul, Dog, Apple



_Spear: 

Welcome to the first official meeting of the Canadian Orange Party

My call sign is Spear, Orange ID CO 919953, and I'm excited and honored to be moderating this first meeting

Current block height is 921,627, and one Canadian dollar currently buys you 647 satoshis, or sats for short, which are fractions of a bitcoin for those unfamiliar

Today is a special day. 17 years ago on this day, Satoshi unveiled the bitcoin white paper to the world, and I think it's a great day to re-read the white paper every year

Thank you all for attending live, and thank you to everyone reading this meeting transcript after the fact

A couple housekeeping items to begin with. As I've mentioned to a few people, the audio is being recorded for this meeting

That audio will be transcribed and made public online in the repo, and so for privacy and security reasons, please don't use your real name during the meetings

If you're going to speak, please begin by saying your call sign so that the transcriber can pick up who's speaking and make sure that's in the transcript

Thank you everyone for choosing your BIP39 wordlist call sign. That's important. If you're emailing Canadian Orange Party, or if you're on Nostr, please maintain consistency with your call sign

I recommend creating a dedicated Nostr key pair for all your work with regards to Canadian Orange Party. It's a wise privacy practice for what we're doing

Once the audio is transcribed, the transcript is going to be reviewed for accuracy with the recording, and once that review is completed, the audio recordings are going to be deleted so that we don't have any voice recognition doxing our call signs or Orange ID

If you're not familiar with the term Orange ID or call sign, if you go to the CanadianOrangeParty.com website, click on protocols, the identification protocol is there and available for everyone.

This might seem extreme, but I think our individual privacy is critical for our future safety

Fiat powers know no limits for how far they'll go to silence the truth or threats to its power, so it's up to us to maintain privacy and protect ourselves long term

Please keep your mic muted until you're ready to speak in order to reduce background noise. And if you wish to speak, just raise your hand, and I'll ask you to speak by naming your call sign

This meeting is going to be 90 minutes, maybe a little bit shorter because we started five minutes late, but I will keep us on time, and I always finish on time

Agenda today: 

5 minutes opening the call

20 minutes reviewing proposals

20 minutes discussing strategies to educate a million Canadians about money

20 minutes unpacking the Orange Oath and refining a definition for Orange politician, which can serve as our way of selecting appropriate politicians that we want to support

10 minutes doing a quick overview of the repo so that everyone's familiar with how to navigate

15 minutes reviewing projects and open roles, and then we'll take a few minutes to close out the call and set the next date for the next meeting

Let's begin

First one is to discuss proposals. So if you want to stay in context and actually see proposals in written form that we're talking about, go to canadianorangeparty.com, click enter, select proposals

That's going to bring you directly to the proposal section of the repo, and you'll be able to follow along that way

It could be helpful. If you're calling in, you won't be able to do that, but I would highly encourage you to go in there and check it all out

It's all in writing. It's all going to be updated dynamically, and I also just want to remind everyone that any member of the Canadian Orange Party can submit a proposal through NOSTR anytime, also through email

You all emailed to get this meeting link, if you want to email a proposal, that's also an okay avenue to do it

The official process or protocol for submitting a proposal is to write up a proposal note on NOSTR, post it as a note on NOSTR along with the block height that you created the proposal at, and tag Canadian Orange Party, the primary npub

It's also helpful if you DM us at the proposal just to make sure nothing gets missed

The proposals will be listed in the GitHub repo dynamically in real time, and if a proposal gets energized by a person or by Sats being funded to it, it becomes a project. That's sort of the flow.

Everything starts as a proposal. Things that are energized with Sats or human energy become projects, and then they're active until they come to their completion or ongoing if there is no end date

So, I'm going to head over to proposals right now, and the way this is going to work is I'm going to start by going through a proposal and give an overview by reading off whatever's written there

Then I'm just going to open the floor for anyone to provide input, to disagree, to agree, to have a different perspective to share, and we'll try that process and see how it goes

Proposal 921.479 is a framework to support orange politicians, and basically, it gives details about the scope and the capital support that we offer aligned politicians, and that can include campaign materials

Those materials could be residential and business signage, apparel, pamphlets, handbooks

It could be regional social media coverage like strategic local ads and maybe even events held at popular businesses

It could also mean assigning a local team of campaign champions to help that politician get the word out and let people know that this politician has taken an oath to stand for sound money

An element of this proposal is designing a simple process for politicians to apply and to self-select, take the oath, plan out their next campaign with sort of a point person with Canadian Orange Party

So, I'm going to open the floor for any discussions, input, any ideas, and I'll just give it 10 seconds of silence

If you want to speak, please do, and frankly, with a group of seven, you don't have to raise your hand

Just unmute your mic, give any input that you want to share, and make sure you start by saying your call sign


_Noble: 

All right, I'll jump in for one quick second here, guys. So, Noble here, call sign.
The one thing that I've been kind of thinking about in terms of tactic, in terms of the best way
to approach this is should we be focusing on finding candidates in areas that we want to
support or even kind of going the almost like New Hampshire Free State Project strategic
method of trying to find particular writings or areas that we think we have the highest
likelihood of having an impact and getting somebody that we want in that position, meaning
going for perhaps the lowest hanging fruit versus trying to have somebody compete in like a
major metropolitan area. There's something I wanted to throw out for discussion. I think that's
a great point.
Frankly, this proposal almost overlooks the possibility of a big corner running for writing. It's
like, is there energy better spent recruiting and converting and convincing an existing politician
to go orange? Or is it in our best interest, like you said, to find the strategic areas that we have
the highest likelihood of succeeding? And I guess one question for you, Noble, is what would
make an area most attractive? Like, what is the criteria for how we would determine if an area is
viable to be selected? And what first comes to mind is high concentration areas of big corners
and maybe even a really, you know, an indicator of that might be a really successful, consistent
meetup. Is that an area that we should start at? Because there's already a community of people
who care about this.
That's kind of exactly right. So the idea being that the larger the population that we have to try
and convince or sway, the harder or more difficult or more entrenched they're going to be. And
our efforts have less impact.
So thinking about the idea of like ROI. So this doesn't mean that like getting behind somebody
who we can convince and support about the ideas is a bad idea. But so I don't know if this data
is accurate, but I was trying to pull up information regarding the smallest population writings.
And like I found one here, it looked like District Code 1004 in Newfoundland, Labrador. The
population is 26,000 people there, right? And so in terms of the amount of votes that you need
to push to win that electorate is 20,000 as of 2011. I'm sure it's much more now, but actually no,
population is 26,000.
So again, it's a population of 26,000. And so if you have basically the entire, at least Canadian
and abroad, Bitcoin army pushing for one tiny district in Labrador to try and really get his
name, his information to actually help him. Also, Bitcoiners are the best when it comes to
marketing material, messaging, drawing up images, even small donations.
Like if you have a tiny writing and he's getting, I don't know, five bucks in stats from a lot of us,
that actually probably goes a long way. It's essentially looking for the weakest link in the chain
and trying to hijack it so that we can actually get somebody in there. I think that's a tremendous
idea.
Probably the strategy that we go with. So conversation to be continued. Anyone else have
anything to put out there with this one? Cool.
Thank you, Noble. Proposal 921342 is for a quarterly webinar and the details are host a
quarterly webinar event open to anyone to join, focus on education and stimulating action.
Invite a roster of talented educators to speak about inflation, basics of money, fundamentals of
wealth building and how to create change in Canada.
Find aligned sponsors to fund the event. Use sponsor proceeds to compensate speakers and
admin team and to promote the session with social media and traditional ads. And the KPI for
that in terms of measuring success would be number of attendees, number of resource
downloads, including the inflation handbook, the letter, which we'll talk about when we get to
projects and the pamphlet packs, which we'll also talk about with projects.
So anything to add with this proposal? I think this is more of the idea here is to create a digital
event that anyone really in Canada can attend. It's not limited by local jurisdiction and could be
a worthwhile way to open source education and put a bunch of really high quality educators
together to offer a live session, which can be recorded and then become evergreen in its
YouTube form and shared widely across the internet. And also the other element here is this
could be chunked out into social media, smaller social media videos that can be used in various
social media campaigns.
So I think the idea here is coordinate and focus a bunch of really good educators to deliver a
high quality digital event and then use that content to spread the reach and spread education
far and wide. Any comments on this one? Call sign noble. Yes, I can provide public facing high
quality educators that are professionals in the space.
Perfect. Give me enough notice. I might be able to provide the best one.
Amazing. I look forward to that. I think the next step with this.
So like I said, this process will be refined, but proposals get energized with human energy,
someone who's volunteering to lead the project or sats, someone or a group of people who
want to zap or send on chain sats dedicated to this specific proposal that then energizes it and
transitions it to a project. The project leader is expected to submit a weekly update, which will
then get plugged into the repo so everyone can stay updated on where this project's at. And
yeah, once energized, we basically pick a date, put together an agenda, and then invite
whoever wants to contribute and help with that project to do so.
So thank you, noble for that. And I'll get in touch with that because I find this one especially
interesting. And I think this is something that can come together faster than some of the other
proposals and can also have immediate effects.
So I'll be in touch. Anyone else? All right. Proposal 929.53 is a letter to politicians.
And the concept here is to draft a one-page letter that can be sent by any Canadian to their
respective member of parliament that brings attention to the problem of currency inflation.
And as just a sample introduction of what this letter would be like, it would be something like,
dear politician, as a citizen in your riding, I'm deeply concerned about currency inflation and
hope that you'll advocate for ending the debasement of my time via currency inflation. After
recently learning the truth about inflation, I'm angry that my time is being devalued by our
government and hope you will address the injustice.
By inflating the supply of currency, the government creates a perverse incentive to spend
excessively and to erode the purchasing power of its citizens, making life harder for everyone.
And as a concerned citizen, I'm asking you to read the policy proposal for Canada's return to a
commodity-backed dollar found here. That's just a sample, but you get the gist.
And really the goal with this one is to create an open-source tool that any Canadian who
recently learns about how money works and the harms of inflation can basically download this
letter and send it by letter mail or by email to their respective politician. And it's basically just a
tool that we can arm all Canadians with to actually have a path to action. Once they learn about
the problem, they can actually just do something.
That letter obviously has to be polished, refined, reviewed, and a version one posted and
available on the website. But I'll open the floor for any suggestions or ideas with that one. I'm
going to end up taking over the whole meeting.
I don't know if it's feasible or possible, but again, the more barriers and hurdles we can get out
of the way for such thing, like again, having it already scripted, ready to go. They can throw it
through chat, DBT or something if they want to as well. It's fantastic.
I don't know if this is feasible or if it could even work, but it would be possible to even have a
landing page where the information is already filled out. They can put in their email and it gets
sent from their email, like some sort of a remailer. Again, don't know if it's feasible, but just the
more we can, the less they have to do, the more point and click we can make it, the higher
likelihood we'll get more participants.
I think the beauty about that too is we can actually track that, which is a more tangible feedback
loop for us to see if this is actually being effective. I'm adding all these notes in real time. As
soon as we're done with the proposal section, I'll hit commit changes.
That'll be in the repo. Anyone at any point who has anything to say about proposals can email
or send a DM on Nostra, and I'll make sure those notes get added to the repo. Right now I'm
the primary maintainer, so I'm handling all comms and all inbound ideas, and right now I'm
making a point to get into here five days a week and make sure everything is added and
available point and click for everyone to access.
I completely agree. I don't see why a remailer wouldn't be feasible. We have a lot of smart
people.
We can put this together. I completely agree. The lower the friction is and the less clicks that
are required, the higher the success rate is going to be of this actually getting done.
I've added those notes, and that'll be addressed. Additionally, I would add that it's worthwhile,
but not as top priority, particularly if we come up to election season, to have another letter sort
of drafted, another template drafted, the purpose of which is to key into the values of the
politicians writing. If the first letter is basically trying to show public support and public
sentiment, and that's social approval, we should also work on building a letter that shows the
advantages for politicians that have gotten behind Bitcoin and just tap into their greed.
It'd be something along the lines of, if any of you work, big supporter, want to share that a lot
of Bitcoiners are interested in your views. Here are the things that we're thinking about. It's
been incredibly successful.
There's a wide audience there. It would help you get your name and your brand out there. If
that's a value for you, we'd love to help promote your campaign if you get on board with these
things.
That's brilliant. I agree, because then it gives us actually an outbound lead to go and send to
politicians around the calendar time of their re-election to basically say, hey, we want to help,
but you have to agree that this is important and worthwhile doing. I mean, all we need is the
first orange politician to get in to be able to have a case to present to all the other politicians to
say, look, this is the support we offered.
These were the assurances that they offered that they are going to focus on fixing the money.
These are the benefits that they received and the help that they received from the Canadian
Orange Party to get them into office. Here's how successful it was.
I think they have a case study to share. It gives them something a lot more tangible than a
promise that hasn't been realized yet. That's a great idea.
Very easy to point to Trump in 2024 and use that as an example. Even with that, we only need it
to work one. I think from conversations that I've had behind closed doors, I think that the last
election, Pierre got very bad advice to stay away from Bitcoin.
I think he could sit on that as well too. But we need to prove in Canada that a Bitcoin politician
can win. Once we have one proof that they can win, it's much easier to convince the rest of
them that, hey, we'll support you if you get behind us.
It's cover your ass. The first thing they're doing is covering their own ass and listening to
terrible pollsters. Yeah.
The other thing too is having data about Canadian Bitcoiners. How many of us are there? How
many people actually care? Maybe even doing our own poll in some way. I don't know the
feasibility of that, but that could be something super interesting to basically say, this is the
percentage of Canadians who have some of their money in Bitcoin and who care about this as
something that's worth focusing on.
I think if we come armed with that, that helps as well. Agreed. Anyone else? It's okay.
We've got a lot of proposals to get through. This part being fast is a good thing. Proposal 92924
is a policy proposal for a sound money standard.
The details of this one are to draft a policy proposal for Canada to return to a sound money
standard, outline a clear purpose, emphasize the problem of unchecked currency inflation
without backing with real commodities, and propose a clear policy to back the Canadian dollar
with the treasury of hard assets held in a network of military secured vaults. That last part
probably doesn't have to be in there. That's more semantics and details.
But essentially the action there is, is it worth drafting a document to be able to send politicians
and to be able to have as a resource for Canadians to actually see? I think lots of details to be
determined. What are the hard assets? How and why are they chosen? There's lots of elements
there. I don't even know if the actual assets themselves necessarily need to be included in the
first version of the policy proposal.
I think the goal of this proposal, which I actually put in there, was we need something real and
tangible to actually lock into. It's like, if we believe that fixing the money is going to fix Canada,
what does fixing the money actually mean? My take is that the first step in fixing the money is
to create guardrails that limit the ability to print money without any restraint. I think having
some sort of backing, I don't know if it's a basket of hard assets or whatever it might be,
Canada clearly has a competitive advantage in certain hard assets, gold, Bitcoin due to energy,
uranium.
We have this abundant resource landscape and I think there just has to be, number one, an
understanding that that's important and number two, that there is actually a way to tether
dollars to some sort of treasury of assets. But I think having a clear policy proposal, even if it
starts simple, is probably something we're going to have to work on eventually. And so I figured
the sooner we start that, the better.
I'll open it up for thoughts, ideas. No bull again. I would just add that leaving it as commodity
backed or to sound money using strategically vague words allows a lot of other people to fill in
the gaps that would be in support of it.
So in just terms of moving it forward, if we just say commodity backed, you're going to get gold
bugs, real estate guys, oil guys, people that know there's a problem with money but maybe
don't see Bitcoin yet, they'll still be, we can play to strategic vagueness. Love that. I'm going to
take a note of that just real quick.
Anyone else? Okay. Next up, proposal 92464. Targeted social media campaigns sponsored by
one or more aligned businesses.
The value to the sponsor business is customer education, exposure, and a public contribution
to improve financial literacy. They can have variable budgets and durations. And the objective is
to get people to download the money handbook, which we'll talk about when we get into
projects.
And the KPI would be number of handbook downloads or website visits. And the rationale
behind this one is that we need a countermeasure to state propaganda. And so effective truth
campaigns done digitally through social media can actually be a really powerful element of
counter propaganda.
Because if we don't have a countermeasure to that, we will just be at a disadvantage moving
forward. And I think our advantage as Bitcoiners and as educators is that we can create way
better campaigns than what the state can produce. And so I think there's some interesting stuff
that can happen there.
But essentially, strategic social media campaigns, self-contained campaigns that have a start
and end date, that have a funding amount, and that have a key sponsor, a business who can
help essentially fund those. We can do it as a case study. We can look back in hindsight what
the result was.
We can learn from every campaign we do. And I think very quickly, we can get to a point where
the money that we're putting into these ads give us a giant exposure net and potentially some
really good results. So I'll open up for anyone with thoughts there before we get into the last
one.
And then we'll move on to the next section of the meeting. Cool. Last proposal, super simple, is
for meme bounties.
So essentially, crowdsource inflation memes with sat bounties and use those memes within
social media campaigns. Prime example of this would be literally create a social media account
that only posts inflation memes. And we just pepper it with 5 to 10 memes a day get put out
there.
People who create them get paid sats for their meme. Maybe the amount of sats that they
receive is directly correlated to the amount of exposure that that meme got on Instagram. I
don't know how we work that out, but it's something that is possible.
So basically, the more eyeballs you grab to learn about inflation, the more sats you get for that
meme you created. And some of the outstanding questions there are how do we judge the
memes? And how do we decide on the bounties of how many sats a meme is worth? And how
do we determine the success of a meme? But I think at the end of the day, Bitcoiners are the
meme lords. Our artillery in this battle is memes.
It's not bullets. And so I think with this proposal, it's more or less how do we create some
structure around it? And how do we create a social media campaign that we can actually plug
the memes into? And I'm happy to be involved with that one. But I just wanted to see if anyone
had thoughts to share.
Perfect. Okay, so that wraps up the proposal review section. We are actually doing pretty good
to be on time.
So next up, we are going to talk about strategies to educate a million Canadians about money.
And before we get into it, and just open the floor for discussion, call sign travel had a last
minute conflict, couldn't attend, but wanted to share a perspective. And he says, the one
thought I had that maybe I could contribute on behalf of the meeting, is that I see it as a
grassroots movement.
I think about dispersed Bitcoin meetups that are happening in communities across country.
And I think it would be great if there was a way to harness these grassroots communities and
somehow connect them all. I see us supporting growing the community meetups across
country, for example, have experienced meetup organizers and coordinators mentor and
support new potential meetup organizers to start meetups in new communities, and then
leverage these growing communities to support the education about money.
And I definitely agree with travel, I think there's already a distributed network of meetups,
Bitcoin meetups. And I think supporting meetup leaders with potentially funding with sending
them sats, or maybe more importantly, written materials for attendees, that the attendees can
read, that gives them a first principles understanding of money, and perhaps even that the
attendees can distribute to friends and family or communities, if they, if they're motivated to do
so would be a good use of time, energy and funds. And I think the starting point to get that
going is for someone to create a database of all the known Canadian meetups, and the
coordinates, the contact coordinates for the organizers.
And maybe I'll right after this meeting is done a lot of proposal, if anyone wants to pick that up
as a project, I think the first step is just creating a database of all the meetups, all the active
meetups that are consistent, and all the details for how to contact the organizers. And then we
can put together sort of an offer and a package that we can send to those organizers and say,
hey, this is who we are, what we do, this is what we can offer, if you're interested, let us know.
And then we can go that way.
But I want to just open the floor. You know, if I want to just discuss strategies to educate a
million Canadians, and that million number wasn't arbitrary, it represents I think, two and a half
percent of the Canadian population. And I think that's all we need.
If a million people in Canada understand how money and banking works. I think there's, you
know, that old Henry Ford quote, if people understood how banking money worked, there'd be
a revolution in the morning. I think most people don't understand how it works.
And if more people did, they would be a lot more inclined to advocate for fixing the money. And
so if we get a million, that's two and a half percent. If that two and a half percent reaches
another percent or two, all we need is 5% to change the course of Canada.
I think 80% of people aren't going to know anything's wrong. Even if things get fixed, they won't
even know what happened. And that's fine.
But all it takes is an intolerant minority who are grounded in truth and think something is
important enough to push forward to actually change things. And so yeah, want to open up the
floor. If anyone has ideas, discussions, or just wants to talk about that, please do so and start
with your call sign.
Noble, I'll just reiterate that an informed minority can always outflank an uninformed majority.
You don't even need a million. It's a very, very small.
Don't forget, these things are usually close as well too. It's not like you have to get all the votes
and everybody on one side of the boat. It's a very, very small amount of people that you need
to convince and actually have a hardened, active role to swing it.
I think part of the education process too is actually getting people a little bit angry.
