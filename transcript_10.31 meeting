Attendees: Spear, Noble, Weekend, Labor, Soul, Dog, Apple, Travel (via email)


_Spear: 

Welcome to the first official meeting of the Canadian Orange Party

My call sign is Spear, Orange ID CO 919953, and I'm excited and honored to be moderating this first meeting

Current block height is 921,627, and one Canadian dollar currently buys you 647 satoshis, or sats for short, which are fractions of a bitcoin for those unfamiliar

Today is a special day. 17 years ago on this day, Satoshi unveiled the bitcoin white paper to the world, and I think it's a great day to re-read the white paper every year

Thank you all for attending live, and thank you to everyone reading this meeting transcript after the fact

A couple housekeeping items to begin with. As I've mentioned to a few people, the audio is being recorded for this meeting

That audio will be transcribed and made public online in the repo, and so for privacy and security reasons, please don't use your real name during the meetings

If you're going to speak, please begin by saying your call sign so that the transcriber can pick up who's speaking and make sure that's in the transcript

Thank you everyone for choosing your BIP39 wordlist call sign. That's important. If you're emailing Canadian Orange Party, or if you're on Nostr, please maintain consistency with your call sign

I recommend creating a dedicated Nostr key pair for all your work with regards to Canadian Orange Party. It's a wise privacy practice for what we're doing

Once the audio is transcribed, the transcript is going to be reviewed for accuracy with the recording, and once that review is completed, the audio recordings are going to be deleted so that we don't have any voice recognition doxing our call signs or Orange ID

If you're not familiar with the term Orange ID or call sign, if you go to the CanadianOrangeParty.com website, click on protocols, the identification protocol is there and available for everyone.

This might seem extreme, but I think our individual privacy is critical for our future safety

Fiat powers know no limits for how far they'll go to silence the truth or threats to its power, so it's up to us to maintain privacy and protect ourselves long term

Please keep your mic muted until you're ready to speak in order to reduce background noise. And if you wish to speak, just raise your hand, and I'll ask you to speak by naming your call sign

This meeting is going to be 90 minutes, maybe a little bit shorter because we started five minutes late, but I will keep us on time, and I always finish on time

Agenda today: 

5 minutes opening the call

20 minutes reviewing proposals

20 minutes discussing strategies to educate a million Canadians about money

20 minutes unpacking the Orange Oath and refining a definition for Orange politician, which can serve as our way of selecting appropriate politicians that we want to support

10 minutes doing a quick overview of the repo so that everyone's familiar with how to navigate

15 minutes reviewing projects and open roles, and then we'll take a few minutes to close out the call and set the next date for the next meeting

Let's begin

First one is to discuss proposals. So if you want to stay in context and actually see proposals in written form that we're talking about, go to canadianorangeparty.com, click enter, select proposals

That's going to bring you directly to the proposal section of the repo, and you'll be able to follow along that way

It could be helpful. If you're calling in, you won't be able to do that, but I would highly encourage you to go in there and check it all out

It's all in writing. It's all going to be updated dynamically, and I also just want to remind everyone that any member of the Canadian Orange Party can submit a proposal through NOSTR anytime, also through email

You all emailed to get this meeting link, if you want to email a proposal, that's also an okay avenue to do it

The official process or protocol for submitting a proposal is to write up a proposal note on NOSTR, post it as a note on NOSTR along with the block height that you created the proposal at, and tag Canadian Orange Party, the primary npub

It's also helpful if you DM us at the proposal just to make sure nothing gets missed

The proposals will be listed in the GitHub repo dynamically in real time, and if a proposal gets energized by a person or by Sats being funded to it, it becomes a project. That's sort of the flow.

Everything starts as a proposal. Things that are energized with Sats or human energy become projects, and then they're active until they come to their completion or ongoing if there is no end date

So, I'm going to head over to proposals right now, and the way this is going to work is I'm going to start by going through a proposal and give an overview by reading off whatever's written there

Then I'm just going to open the floor for anyone to provide input, to disagree, to agree, to have a different perspective to share, and we'll try that process and see how it goes

Proposal 921.479 is a framework to support orange politicians, and basically, it gives details about the scope and the capital support that we offer aligned politicians, and that can include campaign materials

Those materials could be residential and business signage, apparel, pamphlets, handbooks

It could be regional social media coverage like strategic local ads and maybe even events held at popular businesses

It could also mean assigning a local team of campaign champions to help that politician get the word out and let people know that this politician has taken an oath to stand for sound money

An element of this proposal is designing a simple process for politicians to apply and to self-select, take the oath, plan out their next campaign with sort of a point person with Canadian Orange Party

So, I'm going to open the floor for any discussions, input, any ideas, and I'll just give it 10 seconds of silence

If you want to speak, please do, and frankly, with a group of seven, you don't have to raise your hand

Just unmute your mic, give any input that you want to share, and make sure you start by saying your call sign


_Noble: 

All right, I'll jump in for one quick second here, guys. Noble here

The one thing that I've been kind of thinking about in terms of tactic, in terms of the best way to approach this is should we be focusing on finding candidates in areas that we want to support 

Kind of like New Hampshire Free State Project strategic method of trying to find particular ridings or areas that we think we have the highest likelihood of having an impact 

And getting somebody that we want in that position, meaning going for perhaps the lowest hanging fruit versus trying to have somebody compete in like a major metropolitan area. 

There's something I wanted to throw out for discussion. 


_Spear:

I think that's a great point. Frankly, this proposal almost overlooks the possibility of a Bitcoiner running for a politician position

Is our energy better spent recruiting, converting and convincing an existing politician to go orange? 

Or is it in our best interest, like you said, to find the strategic areas that we have the highest likelihood of succeeding? 

And I guess one question for you, Noble, is what would make an area most attractive? 

What is the criteria for how we would determine if an area is viable to be selected? 

And comes to mind is high concentration areas of Bitcoiners and maybe an indicator of that might be a really successful, consistent meetup

Is that an area that we should start at? Because there's already a community of people who care about this


_Noble: 

That's exactly right. So the idea being that the larger the population that we have to try and convince or sway, the harder or more difficult or more entrenched they're going to be

And our efforts have less impact. So thinking about the idea of like ROI. This doesn't mean getting behind somebody who we can convince and support about the ideas is a bad idea

I don't know if this data is accurate, but I was trying to pull up information regarding the smallest population ridings

And like I found one here, it looked like District Code 1004 in Newfoundland, Labrador. The population is 26,000 people there, right? 

And so in terms of the amount of votes that you need to push to win that electorate is 20,000 as of 2011. I'm sure it's much more now, but actually no, population is 26,000.

And so if you have basically the entire, at least Canadian and abroad, Bitcoin army pushing for one tiny district in Labrador to try and really get his name, his information to actually help him

Also, Bitcoiners are the best when it comes to marketing material, messaging, drawing up images, even small donations

Like if you have a tiny riding and he's getting, I don't know, five bucks in stats from a lot of us, that actually probably goes a long way

It's essentially looking for the weakest link in the chain and trying to hijack it so that we can actually get somebody in there. 


_Spear:

I think that's a tremendous idea. Probably the strategy that we go with. So conversation to be continued. Anyone else have anything to put out there with this one? Cool

Thank you, Noble

Proposal 921342 is for a quarterly webinar and the details are host a quarterly webinar event open to anyone to join, focus on education and stimulating action

Invite a roster of talented educators to speak about inflation, basics of money, fundamentals of wealth building and how to create change in Canada

Find aligned sponsors to fund the event. Use sponsor proceeds to compensate speakers and admin team and to promote the session with social media and traditional ads. 

And the KPI for that in terms of measuring success would be number of attendees, number of resource downloads, including the inflation handbook, the letter, which we'll talk about when we get to projects and the pamphlet packs, which we'll also talk about with projects

So anything to add with this proposal? I think this is more of the idea here is to create a digital event that anyone really in Canada can attend

It's not limited by local jurisdiction and could be a worthwhile way to open source education and put a bunch of really high quality educators together to offer a live session

It can be recorded and then become evergreen in its YouTube form and shared widely across the internet

And also the other element here is this could be chunked out into social media, smaller social media videos that can be used in various social media campaigns

So I think the idea here is coordinate and focus a bunch of really good educators to deliver a high quality digital event and then use that content to spread the reach and spread education far and wide

Any comments on this one? 


_Noble:

Yes, I can provide public facing high quality educators that are professionals in the space

Give me enough notice. I might be able to provide the best one


_Spear:

Amazing. I look forward to that. I think the next step with this

So like I said, this process will be refined, but proposals get energized with human energy - someone who's volunteering to lead the project

Or sats, someone or a group of people who want to zap or send on chain sats dedicated to this specific proposal that then energizes it and transitions it to a project

The project leader is expected to submit a weekly update, which will then get plugged into the repo so everyone can stay updated on where this project's at

Once energized, we basically pick a date, put together an agenda, and then invite whoever wants to contribute and help with that project to do so

Thank you, Noble for that. And I'll get in touch with that because I find this one especially interesting

And I think this is something that can come together faster than some of the other proposals and can also have immediate effects

So I'll be in touch. Anyone else? 

All right. Proposal 929.53 is a letter to politicians.

The concept here is to draft a one-page letter that can be sent by any Canadian to their respective member of parliament that brings attention to the problem of currency inflation

And as just a sample introduction of what this letter would be like, it would be something like:

"Dear politician, as a citizen in your riding, I'm deeply concerned about currency inflation and hope that you'll advocate for ending the debasement of my time via currency inflation

After recently learning the truth about inflation, I'm angry that my time is being devalued by our government and hope you will address the injustice

By inflating the supply of currency, the government creates a perverse incentive to spend excessively and to erode the purchasing power of its citizens, making life harder for everyone

And as a concerned citizen, I'm asking you to read the policy proposal for Canada's return to a commodity-backed dollar found here"

That's just a sample, but you get the gist.

And really the goal with this one is to create an open-source tool that any Canadian who recently learns about how money works and the harms of inflation can basically download this letter and send it by letter mail or by email to their respective politician

And it's basically just a tool that we can arm all Canadians with to actually have a path to action

Once they learn about the problem, they can actually just do something

That letter obviously has to be polished, refined, reviewed, and a version one posted and available on the website

I'll open the floor for any suggestions or ideas with that one. I'm going to end up taking over the whole meeting


_Noble:

I don't know if it's feasible or possible, but again, the more barriers and hurdles we can get out of the way for such thing, like again, having it already scripted, ready to go

They can throw it through chatGPT or something if they want to as well. It's fantastic

I don't know if this is feasible or if it could even work, but it would be possible to even have a landing page where the information is already filled out

They can put in their email and it gets sent from their email, like some sort of a remailer

Again, don't know if it's feasible, but just the more we can, the less they have to do, the more point and click we can make it, the higher likelihood we'll get more participants


_Spear:

I think the beauty about that too is we can actually track that, which is a more tangible feedback loop for us to see if this is actually being effective

I'm adding all these notes in real time. As soon as we're done with the proposal section, I'll hit commit changes

That'll be in the repo. Anyone at any point who has anything to say about proposals can email or send a DM on Nostr, and I'll make sure those notes get added to the repo

Right now I'm the primary maintainer, so I'm handling all comms and all inbound ideas, and right now I'm making a point to get into here five days a week and make sure everything is added and available point and click for everyone to access

I completely agree. I don't see why a remailer wouldn't be feasible. We have a lot of smart people. We can put this together

I completely agree. The lower the friction is and the less clicks that are required, the higher the success rate is going to be of this actually getting done

I've added those notes, and that'll be addressed


_Noble:

Additionally, I would add that it's worthwhile, but not as top priority, particularly if we come up to election season, to have another letter drafted, another template drafted, the purpose of which is to key into the values of the politicians riding

If the first letter is basically trying to show public support and public sentiment, and that's social approval, we should also work on building a letter that shows the advantages for politicians that have gotten behind Bitcoin and just tap into their greed

It'd be something along the lines of: "Fan you work, big supporter, want to share that a lot of Bitcoiners are interested in your views. Here are the things that we're thinking about

It's been incredibly successful. There's a wide audience there. It would help you get your name and your brand out there. If that's a value for you, we'd love to help promote your campaign if you get on board with these things"


_Spear:

That's brilliant. I agree, because then it gives us an outbound lead to go and send to politicians around the calendar time of their re-election to basically say, hey, we want to help, but you have to agree that this is important and worthwhile doing

I mean, all we need is the first orange politician to get in to be able to have a case to present to all the other politicians to say, look, this is the support we offered

These were the assurances that they offered that they are going to focus on fixing the money. These are the benefits that they received and the help that they received from the Canadian Orange Party to get them into office. Here's how successful it was.

I think when we have a case study to share it gives them something a lot more tangible than a promise that hasn't been realized yet. That's a great idea.


_Noble:

Very easy to point to Trump in 2024 and use that as an example. Even with that, we only need it to work once

I think from conversations that I've had behind closed doors, I think that the last election, Pierre got very bad advice to stay away from Bitcoin

I think he could sit on that as well too. But we need to prove in Canada that a Bitcoin politician can win

Once we have one proof that they can win, it's much easier to convince the rest of them that, hey, we'll support you if you get behind us

It's cover your ass. The first thing they're doing is covering their own ass and listening to terrible pollsters. Yeah.


_Spear:

The other thing too is having data about Canadian Bitcoiners. How many of us are there? How many people actually care? 

Maybe even doing our own poll in some way. I don't know the feasibility of that, but that could be something super interesting

A sample poll that allows us to say: this is the percentage of Canadians who have some of their money in Bitcoin and who care about this as something that's worth focusing on

I think if we come armed with that, that helps as well. Anyone else? It's okay

We've got a lot of proposals to get through. This part being fast is a good thing

Proposal 92924 is a policy proposal for a sound money standard

The details of this one are to draft a policy proposal for Canada to return to a sound money standard

Outline a clear purpose, emphasize the problem of unchecked currency inflation without backing with real commodities, and propose a clear policy to back the Canadian dollar with the treasury of hard assets held in a network of military secured vaults

That last part probably doesn't have to be in there. That's more semantics and details

But essentially the action there is, is it worth drafting a document to be able to send politicians and to be able to have as a resource for Canadians to actually see? I think lots of details to be determined

What are the hard assets? How and why are they chosen? There's lots of elements there

I don't even know if the actual assets themselves necessarily need to be included in the first version of the policy proposal

The point of this proposal, which I actually put in there, was that we need something real and tangible to actually lock into

If we believe that fixing the money is going to fix Canada, what does fixing the money actually mean? 

My take is that the first step in fixing the money is to create guardrails that limit the ability to print money without any restraint

I think having some sort of backing, I don't know if it's a basket of hard assets or whatever it might be, Canada clearly has a competitive advantage in certain hard assets, gold, Bitcoin due to energy, uranium

We have this abundant resource landscape and I think there just has to be, number one, an understanding that that's important and number two, that there is actually a way to tether dollars to some sort of treasury of assets

But I think having a clear policy proposal, even if it starts simple, is probably something we're going to have to work on eventually

And so I figured the sooner we start that, the better

I'll open it up for thoughts, ideas


_Noble: 

I would just add that leaving it as commodity backed or to sound money using strategically vague words allows a lot of other people to fill in the gaps that would be in support of it

So in just terms of moving it forward, if we just say commodity backed, you're going to get gold bugs, real estate guys, oil guys, people that know there's a problem with money but maybe don't see Bitcoin yet, they'll still be, we can play to strategic vagueness



_Spear:

Love that. I'm going to take a note of that just real quick.

Anyone else? 

Okay. Next up, proposal 92464. Targeted social media campaigns sponsored by one or more aligned businesses

The value to the sponsor business is customer education, exposure, and a public contribution to improve financial literacy

They can have variable budgets and durations. And the objective is to get people to download the money handbook, which we'll talk about when we get into projects

And the KPI would be number of handbook downloads or website visits. And the rationale behind this one is that we need a countermeasure to state propaganda

And so effective truth campaigns done digitally through social media can actually be a really powerful element of counter propaganda

Because if we don't have a countermeasure to that, we will just be at a disadvantage moving forward

And I think our advantage as Bitcoiners and as educators is that we can create way better campaigns than what the state can produce

And so I think there's some interesting stuff that can happen there

But essentially, strategic social media campaigns, self-contained campaigns that have a start and end date, that have a funding amount, and that have a key sponsor, a business who can help fund those

We can do it as a case study. We can look back in hindsight what the result was

We can learn from every campaign we do. And I think very quickly, we can get to a point where the money that we're putting into these ads give us a giant exposure net and potentially some really good results

So I'll open up for anyone with thoughts there before we get into the last one

And then we'll move on to the next section of the meeting

Last proposal, super simple, is for meme bounties

Essentially, crowdsource inflation memes with sat bounties and use those memes within social media campaigns

Prime example of this would be literally create a social media account that only posts inflation memes

And we just pepper it with 5 to 10 memes a day get put out there

People who create them get paid sats for their meme. Maybe the amount of sats that they receive is directly correlated to the amount of exposure that that meme got on Instagram

I don't know how we work that out, but it's something that is possible

So basically, the more eyeballs you grab to learn about inflation, the more sats you get for that meme you created

And some of the outstanding questions there are how do we judge the memes? 

And how do we decide on the bounties of how many sats a meme is worth? And how do we determine the success of a meme? 

But I think at the end of the day, Bitcoiners are the meme lords. Our artillery in this battle is memes. It's not bullets

And so I think with this proposal, it's more or less how do we create some structure around it? 

And how do we create a social media campaign that we can actually plug the memes into? 

And I'm happy to be involved with that one. But I just wanted to see if anyone had thoughts to share

So that wraps up the proposal review section. We are actually doing pretty good to be on time

So next up, we are going to talk about strategies to educate a million Canadians about money

And before we get into it, and just open the floor for discussion


_Travel: 

The one thought I had is that I see it as a grassroots movement

I think about dispersed Bitcoin meetups that are happening in communities across country.

And I think it would be great if there was a way to harness these grassroots communities and somehow connect them all

I see us supporting growing the community meetups across country, for example, have experienced meetup organizers and coordinators mentor and support new potential meetup organizers to start meetups in new communities

And then leverage these growing communities to support the education about money


_Spear:

I definitely agree with travel, I think there's already a distributed network of meetups, Bitcoin meetups

And I think supporting meetup leaders with potentially funding with sending them sats, or maybe more importantly, written materials for attendees to read that gives them a first principles understanding of money

Perhaps the attendees could even distribute to friends and family or communities, if they, if they're motivated to do so would be a good use of time, energy and funds

And I think the starting point to get that going is for someone to create a database of all the known Canadian meetups, and the coordinates, the contact coordinates for the organizers

After this meeting is done I will add that as a proposal, if anyone wants to pick that up as a project, I think the first step is just creating a database of all the meetups, all the active meetups that are consistent, and all the details for how to contact the organizers

And then we can put together sort of an offer and a package that we can send to those organizers and say, hey, this is who we are, what we do, this is what we can offer, if you're interested, let us know

I want to open the floor to discuss strategies to educate a million Canadians, and that million number wasn't arbitrary, it represents I think, two and a half percent of the Canadian population. And I think that's all we need

If a million people in Canada understand how money and banking works. I think there's, you know, that old Henry Ford quote, if people understood how banking money worked, there'd be a revolution in the morning

I think most people don't understand how it works. And if more people did, they would be a lot more inclined to advocate for fixing the money

And so if we get a million, that's two and a half percent. If that two and a half percent reaches another percent or two, all we need is 5% to change the course of Canada

I think 80% of people aren't going to know anything's wrong. Even if things get fixed, they won't even know what happened. And that's fine.

But all it takes is an intolerant minority who are grounded in truth and think something is important enough to push forward to actually change things

And so yeah, want to open up the floor. If anyone has ideas, discussions, or just wants to talk about that, please do so and start with your call sign.


_Noble:

I'll just reiterate that an informed minority can always outflank an uninformed majority. You don't even need a million. It's a very, very small number

Don't forget, these things are usually close as well too. It's not like you have to get all the votes and everybody on one side of the boat

It's a very, very small amount of people that you need to convince and actually have a hardened, active role to swing it


_Spear:

I think part of the education process too is actually getting people a little bit angry, frankly about being stolen from and transmuting that anger into productive action

Someone who's angry can then share that anger with other people and inform them that they're being stolen from. And so I think there's an emotional element

It's like no one thinks they need to learn about money. I think if we make that assumption as a starting point, it fundamentally changes how we go about this

But we really have to grab people. You know, one thing I've started to ask people is, would you would you be okay with someone stealing 5% of your belongings every year? 

Would you be okay with that? And the obvious answer is that everyone says no

And so the reality is people don't know they're being stolen from. And the pathway to getting them to realize that, which is a pretty uncomfortable thing to accept, right? 

Like everyone's biased to not wanting to understand they're being stolen from because it's very inconvenient to acknowledge that as reality. But it is the truth

We need to help people understand that they're being stolen from and that there's actually a way to solve this problem. It will take engagement from all of us to make it happen

I think that's the fundamental mission of Canadian Orange Party is if we improve financial literacy in Canada and propose a pathway to action to solve the problem, we can actually achieve meaningful change

There's already some proposals out there that discuss different pathways for that. But I guess I just wanted to open up the discussion

This will likely be a discussion point that comes up at every meeting because I think it's fundamentally the problem we're trying to solve and getting everyone's ideas is going to be important

So I want to open it up. If anyone has anything else to say, perspective to share, start with your call sign and yeah, feel free. Floor's open


_Labor:

Hey, guys, Labor here. I think one of the important things to realize, too, is that there's at least at least seven or on this call, six people that are already educated and angry

And that number across Canada is certainly not zero, obviously

It might not be a million, but I think one of the strengths of the Orange Party is that it's actually just a kind of a funnel for those people to focus energy and to kind of shift the Overton window to being like, OK, no, there's more

It's not just me that's angry about this. And so I think that just as a perspective, it's not necessarily starting from zero people and educating people from the ground up

There's people of varying amounts of knowledge on this. I'm sure there's plenty of gold bugs in Canada that we can recruit to the cause and plenty of Bitcoiners and all that. So I think that that's just my perspective.


_Spear:

That's a good point, Labor. I think it's almost a coordination function and finding all the people to come together to focus our energy on the winnable battle or the winning strategy is maybe even a bigger component

And I think if we take it more broadly, you know, there may not be a huge amount. There's definitely more than six. There's probably thousands

Frankly, there's probably hundreds of thousands of people who have some knowledge of the fact that the money's broken, but maybe haven't gotten to the point of like true understanding where they're righteously angry about it

But there's a lot of people that feel the pain of inflation, that have this invisible thing sort of pushing on them. And I think some people literally just need the dots connected. Right? 

It's like, it's not you. It's not the system. It's not your inability to navigate finances. It's the money.

The money is broken. And so yeah, it's the coordination function might even end up being a bigger function required than the straight up education to bring people from zero to understanding

It might just be bring people with the understanding together with a singular strategy. We'll probably find a lot of people doing work to bring awareness about the broken money

But if everyone's doing their own thing, you don't get this concentrated inertia that's enough to create a measurable change

And so I guess labor, how does that change the strategy? How do we find those people? And yeah, it's like, what are the implications of that? Because I agree.


_Labor:

I think that it's just going to happen. I think that if we're doing our job that a lot of people are going to see it just over social media. Or maybe that's my hope. But other than that, I don't know


_Spear:

Maybe it's just about finding those circles. Finding those little micro communities that might be scattered. Hard money finance groups, gold bug groups

All these people in their own mini ecosystem within the sound money realm and getting everyone together. That's a good point. Anyone else?


_Apple:

Hi, Apple here. I just want to add the perspective of saying Canada's money is ruined because of inflation is incomplete. You also have to add Canadians don't own

There's no true ownership like in Bitcoin. And I feel that that's the missing piece. 


_Spear:

Can you elaborate on that a little? I agree


_Apple:

I mean, the inflation part, it will create anger. That's true. But it's incomplete. You also need to encourage people to be proud of owning their money


_Spear:

I agree

I saw a chart the other day that basically had Canada at the top, and it was the amount of debt per household, I think was the number. And it was pretty shocking. 

And I think that is just proof that Canadians are over levered with fiat debt.

I guess the question there is, is that an artifact of broken fiat money that basically nudges people to take on more and more debt, more and more credit? 

And does valuing ownership get resolved by fixing the money so that people are more inclined to own things and think about what it means to own something if they can't just borrow incessantly to get things that they can't afford? 

I guess Parami still thinks it's a derivative of the broken money. It's definitely a separate symptom than just inflation in and of itself. But it seems related

Thanks, Apple. That was good input. Okay, move on to the next topic

And it's about refining clear selection criteria for orange politicians that we support. And in thinking about this, the idea of an oath came to mind

Because instead of writing down all these different qualities of a politician we want to support, I think frankly, the selection criteria can be extremely simple

If we have a clear, explicit oath, a set of sentences that someone has to agree with to really be considered someone who's aligned, it can serve as a very simple self-selection criteria

It can also serve as an accurate measure of whether someone deserves to be supported by the orange party

The inspiration partially came from the notion of the Hippocratic Oath, which debatable how much utility that has now or how impactful it is now in the world of modern medicine

But historically, the Hippocratic Oath was an ethical oath for doctors to uphold ethical standards

And to me, regardless of whether it's called the Orange Oath or Satoshiocratic Oath was another word that was floated out on NOSTR by a member, that oath can serve as an ethical oath for politicians to uphold ethical governance

And so it can be sort of a parallel to the Hippocratic Oath. And I'm just going to go in to the repo.

There's an Orange Oath section. There's a version 1.1 posted in there, which will be continuously updated

There's also a discussion that I'm going to have with another member about the distinction between an oath and a prayer and the distinction there

And, you know, I don't know if this has to be this rigid thing, but I think having a template is helpful

Version 1.1 of the Orange Oath is: 

"I solemnly swear by my life and my love of it that I will relentlessly expose the theft of currency inflation, teaching about its erosion of wealth and liberty

I vow to restore and fiercely defend a sound money standard rooted in truth so that current and future Canadians may live freely with abundance"

That's probably a bit wordier than it needs to be, but the crux of it is two portions

First one, I swear to expose the theft of currency inflation and teach about the erosion of wealth and liberty that it has

And the second part is a vow to restore, first restore, and then fiercely defend a sound money standard rooted in truth

Now, where does this become useful when selecting politicians? Well, the simple way is you give that to a politician. You say, do you agree and stand by this?

And are you willing to publicly swear this oath that you will uphold this in your duties as a representative of people in your riding?

I don't know if there's going to be resistance to that, if it's appropriate, if it's doable

What I do know is if a politician does say that and actually means it deep in their soul and understands it, it creates a clarity that allows them to maybe take a singular focus on what issues they bring up in their discussions

Imagine if during open question period in the House Commons, every orange politician brought this up every time they have an opportunity to speak? It creates an awareness around something that I don't see talked about at all, frankly

So what are people's thoughts about, just in general, how we, as a group that finds common unity on the idea that fixing the money is the way we fix Canada, how do we, as a group, select which politicians to support?

Still lots to discuss about what that support actually looks like

But fundamentally, just to open the conversation, how do we actually decide who to support? What do people think about the oath?

I want to open the floor for anyone who has thoughts to share ane I'll put notes in the repo as people are talking


_Labor:

I don't think I've ever actually met a politician. But I think that it would involve meeting, I'm just thinking of this, basically, it would involve meeting a politician, having a discussion about it

And if they agree, or are somewhat a part of this, this network, you know, or if we're supporting them, and they seem to be advocating for Orange values

That would lead to their support by us. And then having that oath, I think would be helpful for sure

I was thinking one of the o ways that they can kind of like earn a badge of approval is maybe having something on their campaign products that is like orange party approved

Or like orange, even just like some kind of memetic advertisement, almost like a, like an org certified organic stamp on it that assists in in selling them to the population

That's just initial thoughts for me


_Spear:

I agree, the idea of the bright orange maple leaf is something that I come back to as this sort of metaphor for Canada finding a bright orange future within a space of darkness

And so I think perhaps the bright orange maple leaf being something like a stamp of approval, like you said, basically saying, the Canadian orange party

I think one thing that does is we don't necessarily have to create a political party

This isn't about creating necessarily a political party to like go into the fray and have members of parliament be from that party. A liberal politician who aligns with the fundamental desire to fix the money can be an orange politician, they can be an orange liberal politician. And I think there's, there's more flexibility there to say, you can be on team blue or team red, but still align with the mission of team orange.
And it's not a conflict, it's not in competition. It's literally just asking the question, do you agree that fixing the money is important? And will you swear to address this problem with ferocity, based on the idea that this is the core problem, all the other problems are subordinate to this problem. And I love the idea of all of us who are involved with this being able to literally just reach out to whatever politician to meet our first politician and have that conversation.
And to bring back notes as a feedback loop to say, yeah, I met my politician, I had this conversation. This is how it went. This is what I wasn't expecting.
This is what I was expecting. So, you know, maybe from now until the next meeting, on November 21, you know, I'll make a vow to go and find a politician to talk to and have a conversation with them. And I encourage anyone else who has the bandwidth and ability to do that to do it as well.
Even if it's a 15 minute conversation, I think you can probably get a lot of information as to number one, their awareness of the money problem and two, their openness to learning about it. And potentially, you know, advocating for it. But I think the orange maple leaf could be our stamp of approval.
And I think having some element of emphasizing the problem of money in their campaign messaging materials, all that kind of stuff. And even, you know, I almost picture signs that people put on their front yards for politicians. Having the bright orange maple leaf on a bunch of signs that are maybe blue, maybe red, doesn't matter.
Do you have the bright orange maple leaf on your sign, on your writing? You know, will you wear a bright orange maple leaf badge when you're in the House of Commons, like a pin? It's like, that is the mimetic element of being able to align everyone with different opinions and perspectives and potentially even political parties to say, this issue of broken money transcends whatever subordinate solutions you might, or whatever opinions you might have on how to solve these trickle down problems. Can you align and will you be vocal about the idea that we need to fix the money? So I agree. That's a great idea.
Apple here, I want to add, if we have some orange oath, we need also to have on the side some sort of leaderboard to see how aligned each politician is. And what kind of elements would you have on the leaderboard? My top one would be the most aligned with the oath. I almost feel like the oath needs to be binary.
It's like either you align or you don't. There's not really a middle ground. And I guess the

 behaviors would be what we would track, right? It's like, okay, gather a line with the oath and you're willing to take it publicly, maybe even be recorded while doing it.
I think that would be a good forum for the podcast, where we could have these politicians on, speak with them, gather their inputs, good exposure for them. And if they're commensurate to it, have them take their oath on the podcast publicly, because I think it could potentially be taken very seriously. When you're putting out a public oath, you are putting out social accountability to a large degree, especially if the oath is very clear, there's no wiggle room.
But the back end of that is, if they've taken the oath, are their behaviors actually reflecting the oath they took? And an out of 12 opportunities to speak in the House of Commons, what percentage of those did you bring up the problem of money? That would be super interesting, because then we can actually put that as a public facing leaderboard to say, yeah, these are all the orange politicians who took the oath, senators, members of parliament, municipal members of parliament, like all that. And then out of X amount of speaking opportunities, here's the percentage of those opportunities that they used as an opportunity to bring up broken money. That would be super interesting.
We can hear. Just on the subject of the oath, just for context, I think there's great intentions behind it. But I do think if looking to convert existing politicians from existing parties to take an oath, I do think there's probably an optics issue there.
And from my perspective, like those politicians don't take an oath to their individual parties. So I would perceive taking an oath as being a higher standard than even the standard they've committed to their existing parties. I'm not saying it's the wrong direction to go in, but just for context.
That's a good point. I mean, this is a totally new, this is uncharted territory. I love what you said about it being the oath transcending their party, which I think actually aligns with the idea that this mission of fixing the money can actually transcend whatever political agenda you're being part of.
But I can definitely understand the hesitation of, you know, the seriousness of this is not a light thing, right? You don't want these Bitcoiners coming up and say, hey, you need to take an oath, which is why I think we just, you know, Bitcoin, we all know that orange stands for Bitcoin, but I think the optics of this should be such that orange stands for freedom and freedom comes by fixing the money. And just accepting that when people learn about the money, to a certain extent, they will come to Bitcoin, but we don't have to, we don't have to go to them with Bitcoin. So that's a really good point weekend.
And might actually be a forcing function that maybe we need to find Bitcoiners who are willing to lean in to politics, instead of trying to convert existing politicians. I don't know. I think after a few conversations that we have with politicians to get a sense of where they're at, and even just putting it out there, and seeing how they react, what they say, what the reservations are, I think

 all that's going to be really good data and probably reinforces the need for us to just go out there and speak to some politicians.
Because labor, I'm with you, I've never actually spoken to a politician, mostly because I've not really given it any acknowledgment as being a serious endeavor or something that affects my life until having the insight that, well, if I don't engage with it, it's going to affect my life at some point, and it's definitely going to affect my family's life. So we kind of have to engage, which is, I think, why we're all here. And I'm very grateful for everyone being here.
Anything else to say about that? Otherwise, we'll move on. Okay, awesome. I'm just going to commit those changes.
So as we go through the meeting, I'll take notes. When we're done a section, I'll commit them to the repo. They'll be there live, just so that we can refer to them.
And the meeting notes are in the repo. Let's do a quick repo overview right now. So if you do go the website, canadianorangeparty.com, you click enter, it'll bring you to a page where there's six buttons.
Nostra gives you our Nostra coordinates. Donate allows people to donate Bitcoin only right now. Protocols are sort of this evolving set of procedures that we align with so that we can harmonize how we do things, how we identify ourselves, how we run meetings, etc.
That'll be evolving. Meetings will have sort of a list of the meetings, and things that are on the agenda to talk about. That still has to be updated.
Next up is proposals and projects. So at any point, you can actually check out what proposals are outstanding, and also what projects are in motion. So there's not really much to navigate.
It's pretty self-explanatory. When you do get into the repo, and GitHub might be unfamiliar for many, it was for me for a long time, but I find it's a really good way to organize systems, or organize information in a database. If you scroll, if you look at the menu on the left side, you'll see Y underscore meeting, and then dates.
So those are the meeting notes that I'm reading from and also adding there. And then anything with X underscore is an active project, and that's just the detail file to unpack what's going on with that project, and some details of what's being worked on, basically. And there are some tabs that don't show up on the website.
For example, updates, orange oath, open roles. These are sections that aren't available on the website, but that you can navigate once you're in the repository. And if anything's confusing, clunky, needs updating, feel free to reach out by email or on Noster.
This is just sort of, this has only been being worked on for a week. And so I just kind of put things together in in as organized a way as I could, but surely this will be changed, tweaked,

and improved, and updated over time. The readme file is sort of an intro to what this repo actually is.
And then underneath that, read this letter, is a modified version of a speech that was given at the Bitcoin conference. Still a work in progress. If you have anything to add, please don't be shy.
If you have a proposal to submit, no proposal is a bad proposal. The ones that don't get energized will just stay in this sort of mempool of proposals, I guess we could call it. But that's essentially how you navigate the repo.
If anyone has questions or needs help, just reach out to me. Me, Spear, is the guy behind the Canadian Orange Party email, which you all have because you all received a link for this meeting. So anyway, that's all we need to do for navigating that.
Next up, I want to get into, we only have 30 minutes left. So I want to get into reviewing current projects and open roles. So if you're in the repo, you can go to projects.
That's a list of projects that are currently in motion. I'll go through. Everyone can kind of read that and see it themselves.
Inside here is going to basically, when a proposal turns into a project, the description gets unpacked and expanded on in here. When the project gets big enough that there's a lot happening, a dedicated file gets created for it, which is where you'll see in the repo, X underscore has the project name, and then the block height where that project was created. So I'll just give a really brief overview of the projects that are currently underway.
And then I just want to open the floor for anyone to add input or ask questions about current projects that are unclear. In the project section, they're ranked by priority, whereas in proposals, they're ranked chronologically by block height at which they were suggested. So priority one projects, we have Opus, which is a bifold pamphlet all about inflation.
So most people don't understand what inflation is. They've all heard the word. They all feel the pain.
