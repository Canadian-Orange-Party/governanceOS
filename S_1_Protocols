Protocols codify how we do things as a distributed network of individuals coordinating to achieve change


Principles:
- We use pseudonymous identifiers to remain private so we can work publicly without fear of persecution
- We decentralize contribution as much as possible. Anyone can submit a proposal, record a podcast or apply for open roles

"Central" refers to: npub1hkprtpymah577g9vxcn6nyuj9jfckh3v3kmgvdaff5sesl0ase2sqn6jqu (primary nostr account)



-------> [ORANGE ID & CALL SIGN] -> A private ID system that we use to protect ourselves and find each other on nostr

Orange ID format: “CO_Orange block”

CO = Canadian Orange
Orange block = block height you turned orange and created your Orange ID


CALL SIGN: a short form ID linked to your Orange ID that can be used in meetings and on nostr 

Format: Pick a word from the BIP39 word list 



-------> [ACTIVATION] -> A protocol for signalling that you are online and seeking to contribute

Complete the following two actions:

1) Post a note on nostr that says “[your call sign]_online” and tag Central

2) Send Central a DM with information about what skills/abilities you have and how you want to help

-

Your note will be zapped 121 sats by Central to confirm activation

Your note will be reposted on Central account to signal other members that you are online

Your Orange ID and associated call sign will be added to our GitHub database of operators



-------> [PROPOSAL] -> A protocol for submitting a proposal

- Post a note on nostr, tag Central
- Proposal will be added to the repo and discussed at the next meeting
- Proposals that are energized by individuals or sats become projects



-------> [UPDATES]

- Project leaders submit weekly updates by posting "UPDATE", tagging central and including any relevant information about their project



-------> [MEETING]

- A protocol for how we meet in cyberspace for discussions
- Template: review proposals, discuss questions, review projects and open roles
- Moderator takes notes and adds to repo in real time
- 21st of every month (exception: first meeting will be held on 10.31)
- 1200 - 13:30 ET
- Raise your hand to speak if you have a perspective to share
