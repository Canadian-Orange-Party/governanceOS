A growing database of high quality, curated resources

Eventually, create a Canadian Orange Library website that offers an intuitive and simple navigation digital library

"mempool" lists resource submissions

Resource gets added to library from mempool once X number of contributors vote on it

Labelling:
- Topic (money, Bitcoin, economics, philosophy, psychology, energy, politics)
- Medium (audio, written, video)
- Complexity level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

WORK IN PROGRESS
