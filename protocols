Protocols codify how we do things as a distributed network of individuals coordinating to achieve change


Principles:
- We use pseudonymous identifiers to remain private so we can work publicly without fear of persecution
- We decentralize contribution as much as possible. Anyone can submit a proposal, record a podcast or apply for open roles



[ORANGE ID & CALL SIGN] -> A private ID system that we use to protect ourselves and find each other

Orange ID format: “CO_Orange block”

CO = Canadian Orange
Orange block = block height you turned orange and created your Orange ID


CALL SIGN: a short form ID linked to your Orange ID that can be used in meetings and on nostr 

Format: Pick a word from the BIP39 word list 


[ACTIVATION] -> A protocol for signalling that you are online and seeking to contribute

Complete the following two actions:

1) Post anote thats says “[your call sign]_online” and tag @CanadianOrangeParty

2) Send the primary npub a DM with information about what skills/abilities you have and how you want to help

-

Your note will be zapped 121 sats to confirm activation

Your note will be reposted on this account to signal other members that you are online

Your Orange ID and associated call sign will be added to our GitHub database of operators



[PROPOSAL] -> A protocol for submitting a proposal

- Post a note on nostr, tag @CanadianOrangeParty

- Mike adds proposal to repo, to be discused at the next meeting
- Proposals are voted. Those approved become projects. Funded projects are actioned. Project leader submits a debrief once project is complete



[UPDATES]
