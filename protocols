Protocols codify how we do things as a distributed network of individuals coordinating to achieve change


Principles:
- We use pseudonymous identifiers to remain private so we can work publicly without fear of persecution
- We decentralize contribution as much as possible. Anyone can submit a proposal, record a podcast or apply for open roles



[ORANGE ID & CALL SIGN]

A private ID system that we use to protect ourselves and find each other


[ACTIVATION]

[PROPOSAL]
- A protocol for submitting a protocol
