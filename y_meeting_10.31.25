Welcome to the first official meeting for the Canadian Orange Party

My call sign is Spear, orange ID CO_919953. I'm excited and honoured to be moderating this first meeting

Current block height is 921,627 and 1 canadian dollar currently buys you 647 satoshis, or sats for shott, which are fractions of a bitcoin

Today is a special day. 17 years ago today, Satoshi unveiled the Bitcoin whitepaper to the world. Great day to re-read the whitepaper every year, I plan to do that later today 

Thank you all for attending live and thank you to everyone reading this meeting transcript



A few housekeeping items to begin with:


1. The audio of this meeting is being recorded

The audio will be transcribed and made public online in the repository. For privacy and security reasons, please do not use your real name during meetings

If you haven't already, please choose a word from the BIP39 wordlist and use that as your indetifier for all meetings and also ideally on NOSTR to maintain consistency

Once transcribed, the transcript will be reviewed for accuracy with the recording and upon review completion, audio recordings will be deleted to prevent voice recognition doxxing our Orange ID 

We created an identification protocol which is available on the website

Before you speak, please identify yourself with your call sign 

This may seem extreme but we feel it’s critical for our individual privacy and safety

The fiat powers know no limits for how far they will go to silence truth or threats to its powers. It’s up to us to maintain privacy to protect ourselves long term.


2. Please keep your mic muted until you are ready to speak to reduce background noise

3. Please update your name to your call sign so others on the call know who is speaking

4. If you wish to speak, please raise your hand and I will ask you to speak by naming your call sign

5. This meeting will be 90 minutes

1. Discuss proposals [20min]

A reminder that any active operator can submit a proposal through NOSTR

Two steps:

1. Tag our primary npub in a note that includes a proposal identifier and a details of the proposal
2. DM our primary npub a link to your note so it doesnt get missed

Go to proposals. Read then open floor for input or discussion

Proposals can be submitted by anyone, anytime

If a proposal is energized by a person or by sats, it becomes a project

2. Discuss strategies to educate 1m Canadians about money. Propose tools & techniques, metrics to track results [20min]

Input from call sign travel who had a last minute conflict and couldnt attend but wanted to share a perspective

He says:

- The one thought I had that maybe you could contribute on my behalf regarding educating 1M Canadians about money is that I see it as a grassroots movement. 
- I think about dispersed Bitcoin meetups that are happening in communities across the country and think it would be great if there was a way to harness these grassroots communities and somehow connect them all
- I see us supporting growing the community meetups across the country 
- e.g. have experienced meetup organizers mentor/support new potential meetup organizers to start meetups in new communities and then leverage these growing communities to support the education about money

I agree. Theres already a distributed network of meetups. Supporting meetup leaders with potentially funding and written materials for attendees to read and perhaps distribute about money is a great idea

Starting point there is for someone to create a database of all known canadian meetups and the coordinates to contact the organizer. I can add that as a proposal if anyone wants to pick up that project





Tools:
- Inflation pamphlet [Opus]
- Inflation handbook [Kryptonite]
- Wealth handbook pdf

Techniques:
- Digital: social media campaigns sponsored by FLNP
- Analog: print media, ads,

KPI: handbook downloads

3. Refine a clear selection criteria for Orange members of parliament that we support [20min]

Clearly define what it means to be an orange politician. 

Draft an orange oath (an ethical code for politicians)

Hippocratic oath is an ethical oath for doctors to uphold ethical standards

The Orange oath is an ethical oath for politicians to uphold ethical governance

Allow any current politicians to self select, swear the orange oath and receive funding an/or orange campaign materials
