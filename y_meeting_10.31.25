Welcome to the first official meeting for the Canadian Orange Party

Current block height is and 1 cad buys you X sats

Today is a special day. 17 years ago today, Satoshi unveiled the Bitcoin whitepaper to the world. Great day to re-read the whitepaper every year

My call sign is Spear, orange ID CO_919953. I'm excited and honoured to be moderating this first call

Thank you all for attending live and thank you to everyone reading this meeting transcript



A few housekeeping items to begin with:


1. The audio of this meeting is being recorded

The audio will be transcribed and made public online. For privacy and security reasons, please do not use your real name during meetings

Once transcribed, the audio files will be reviewed for accuracy with the recording and upon review completion, audio recordings will be deleted to prevent voice recognition doxxing our Orange ID 

We created an identification protocol which is available on the website

Before you speak, please identify yourself with your orange ID or call sign

This may seem extreme but we feel it’s critical for our individual privacy and safety

The fiat powers know no limits for how far they will go to silence truth or threats to its powers. It’s up to us to maintain privacy to protect ourselves long term.


2. Please keep your mic muted until you are ready to speak to reduce background noise

3. Please update your name to your call sign

4. If you wish to speak, please raise your hand and I will ask you to speak by naming your call sign
