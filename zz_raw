Diefenbaker speech:

"I am a Canadian, a free Canadian, free to speak without fear, free to worship God in my own way, Free to transact without censorship

Free to stand for what I think right, free to oppose what I believe wrong, free to choose those who govern my country

This heritage of freedom I pledge to uphold for myself and all mankind"
