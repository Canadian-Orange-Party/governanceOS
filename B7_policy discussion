The Big 7

1. End currency inflation by adopting sound money (disables control over media and justice system)

2. Restore the charter as supreme law in Canada, appoint Guardians to enforce the law without prejudice or privilege

3. End all media and foreign funding

4. Formation of merchant courts, creation of a Justice Task Force to independently investigate and prosecute political criminals and the media for deception

5. Deport all illegals from Canada

6. End all taxes with the exception of a 5% consumption tax on products & services and a 15% flat tax on earnings

7. End the fraudulent capaign against carbon and prioritize Canadian energy sovereignty


Extra: Restore our national flag to the red ensign





NOTES:

4_Public courts which are inefficient, wasteful and easily corrupted by fiat would be replaced by merchant courts. Public courts are slow and expensive. Merchant courts are fast and inexpensive, they democratize justice
