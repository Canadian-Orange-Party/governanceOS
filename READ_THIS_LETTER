Hello fellow Canadian

Thank you for being here and reading this

Our country is not doing well

Our freedoms, quality of life, safety and national wealth are eroding at an alarming pace and we must take action

If you're tired of being ripped off by inflation

If you're concerned about the erosion of your freedoms

If you're frustrated from watching the Canadian government wasting money and squadering Canada's wealth

Then this letter was written for you 

The Candian Orange Party is a movement by Canadians to fix the money so we can fix our country


Einstein said:

"The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything"


To modify Einsteins words to fit our current predicament:

Canada won't be destroyed by politicians, but by Canaddians who watch them destroy and enslave the country without doing anything

I'm writing this leter because I refuse to watch time thieves loot and control Canadians while doing nothing to stop it


By controlling and manipulating the Canadian currency, unelected bankers have gained control of our country and are eroding our quality of life and freedoms

If nothing changes, a dark, dystopian Canada is approaching very fast and our generation risks going down in history as the last one that had freedoms and privacy

Will you allow that to happen under your watch?

We didn't create the mess but it's our responsibility to end the corruption and restore society for future generations

We're doing this to protect our families and leave our children a safe, healthy and wealthy Canada

We refuse to run away or stand by and allow Canadian freedoms to be taken away by fiat scum

Canada is a majestic land with abundant resouces

Canadians are mostly kind, considerate, resilient people

Under a sound money standard and with competent leadership, Canada will be one of the wealthiest nations on earth

If you are someone who sees politics as the make believe theatre that it has become, you may have opted out of the political theatre

The problem with that is that if good people opt out of the political process, we leave an opportunity for unscrupulous, incompetent individuals to insert themselves and eventually affect how we live

To fix this mess we need to focus our energy on the root cause problem: broken money

Broken money directly causes inflation

Broken money incentivizes government waste

Broken money creates massive suffering

Broken money leads to rampant waste and consumerism

We vow to fix the money so we can fix Canada

We are ushering in a mass return of civic engagement

A culture of engaging our representatives and informing them about the problem of broken money



Most Canadians seem to have two choices:

If you still have faith in politics, you can vote red or blue

If you've lost faith in politics, you can exit or insulate 


Those who still have faith in politics don't yet understand that red or blue is really the illusion of choice because neither team addresses the root problem of broken money 

If you've lost faith in politics, you can exit the country for the sake of your health and quality of life or protect yourself from the increasing chaos created by broken money

If you care about your friends and family, exit and insulate are both negative options because your friends and family will suffer from the increasing chaos and damage caused by broken money


I’m writing this letter to tell you that as of September 23, 2025 there is a third option called the Canadian Orange Party

Orange is the colour of sound money, freedom and abundance

We unify and coordinate to solve the single, largest problem Canada faces today: broken money

To be specific, The Canadian Orange Party focuses on the singular political mandate of ending currency inflation
