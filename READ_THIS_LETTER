Hello fellow Canadian

Thank you for being here and reading this

Our country is not doing well. Our freedoms, quality of life, safety and national wealth are eroding at an alarming pace and we have a choice to make

If you're tired of being ripped off by inflation

If you're concerned about your freedoms being eroded

If you're angry about watching your government wasting money and squadering Canada's wealth

Then this letter was written for you to inform you about a third option - the Candian Orange Party


Einstein said:

"The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything"


To modify Einsteins words to fit our current predicament:

Canada won't be destroyed by politicians, but by Canaddians who watch them destroy and enslave the country without doing anything

I'm writing this leter because I refuse to watch time thieves loot and control Canadians while doing nothing to stop it


By controlling and manipulating the Canadian currency, unelected bankers have gained control of our country and are eroding our quality of life and freedoms at an alarming rate

If nothing changes, a dark, dystopian Canada is approaching very fast and our generation risks going down in history as the last one that had freedoms and privacy

Not on my watch

The mess was not created by us but it's our responsibility to end the corruption and restore society for future generations

I'm doing this to protect my family and leave my children a Canada they are proud to live in

I refuse to be one of the Canadians that ran away or stood by and allowed Canadian freedoms to be taken away by fiat scum

Canada is a majestic land with abundant resouces

Canadians are mostly kind, considerate, resilient people

Under a sound money standard and with competent leadership, Canada will be one of the wealthiest nations on earth

If you are someone who sees politics as the make believe theatre that it has become, you may have opted out of the political theatre

The problem with that is that if good people opt out of the political process, we leave an opportunity for unscrupulous, incompetent individuals to insert themselves and eventually affect how we live

To fix this mess we need to focus our energy on the root cause problem: broken money

Broken money is the source of inflation

Broken money is the source of government waste

Broken money is the source of incredible suffering

Broken money leads to rampant waste and consumerism

It's time to fix the money so we can fix Canada

It's to usher in a mass return of civic engagement

A culture of engaging our representatives and informing them about the problem of broken money


---> THIRD CHOICE


Most Canadians seem to have two choices:

If you still have faith in politics, you can vote red or blue

If you've lost faith in politics, you can exit or insulate 


Those who still have faith in politics don't yet understand that red or blue is really the illusion of choice because neither team addresses the root problem of broken money 

If you've lost faith in politics, you can exit the country for the sake of your health and quality of life or protect yourself from the increasing chaos created by broken money

If you care about your friends and family, exit and insulate are both negative options because your friends and family will suffer from the increasing chaos and damage caused by broken money


Iâ€™m writing this letter to tell you that as of September 23, 2025 there is a third option called the Canadian Orange Party

Orange is the colour of sound money, freedom and abundance

We unify and coordinate to solve the single, largest problem Canada faces today: broken money

To be specific, The Canadian Orange Party focuses on the singular political mandate of ending currency inflation
