Hello fellow Canadian

Thank you for being here and reading this

Our country is not doing well. Our freedoms, quality of life, safety and national wealth are eroding at an alarming pace and we have a choice to make

If you're tired of being ripped off by inflation

If you're concerned about your freedoms being eroded

If you're angry about watching your government wasting money and squadering Canada's wealth

Then this letter was written for you to inform you about a third option - the Candian Orange Party


Einstein said:

"The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything"


To modify Einsteins words to fit our current predicament:

Canada won't be destroyed by politicians, but by Canaddians who watch them destroy and enslave the country without doing anything

I'm writing this leter because I refuse to watch time thieves loot and control Canadians while doing nothing to stop it


By controlling and manipulating the Canadian currency, unelected bankers have gained control of our country and are eroding our quality of life and freedoms at an alarming rate

If nothing changes, a dark, dystopian Canada is approaching very fast and our generation risks going down in history as the last one that had freedoms and privacy

Not on my watch

The mess was not created by us but it's our responsibility to end the corruption and restore society for future generations

I'm doing this to protect my family and leave my children a Canada they are proud to live in

I refuse to be one of the Canadians that ran away or stood by and allowed Canadian freedoms to be taken away by fiat scum

Canada is a majestic land with abundant resouces

Canadians are mostly kind, considerate, resilient people



If we opt out of the political process, we leave an opportunity for unscrupulous, incompetent individuals to insert themselves and affect how we live

We must usher in a mass return of civic engagement

A culture of engaging our representatives and informing them about the problem of broken money
