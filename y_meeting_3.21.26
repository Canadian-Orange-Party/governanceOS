QUOTE CONTEXT

"The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws," is attributed to the Roman historian and politician Tacitus (c. 56 – c. 120 CE). 

Found in his work The Annals of Imperial Rome, this phrase suggests that a high volume of legislation is a sign of moral decay, with excessive rules often masking systemic corruption and political dysfunction

Context: Tacitus, writing about the Roman Empire, believed that as governments become more corrupt and lose virtue, they attempt to maintain control by creating endless regulations.

Meaning: Instead of ensuring justice, an abundance of laws often serves to empower the ruling class and mask the breakdown of true order.

Variations: While the most common translation is "The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws," it is sometimes cited as "The more numerous the laws, the more corrupt the government".
