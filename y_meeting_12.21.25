Welcome to the third meeting for the Canadian Orange Party

My call sign is Spear, orange ID CO_919953. I'm honoured to be moderating this session

Current block height is 928,863 and 1 canadian dollar currently buys you 820 sats

Thank you all for attending live or reading this meeting transcript in future



A few housekeeping items to begin with:


1. This meeting is being recorded

The audio will eventually be transcribed and made public online in the repository. For privacy and security reasons, please do not use your real name during meetings

We recommend creating a dedicated nostr keypair with your call sign for consistency

Before you speak, please identify yourself with your call sign 

Remaining pseudonymous may seem extreme but we feel it’s critical for our individual privacy and safety

The fiat powers know no limits for how far they will go to silence truth or threats to its powers. It’s up to us to maintain privacy to protect ourselves long term.


2. Please keep your mic muted until you are ready to speak to reduce background noise


3. If you wish to speak, please raise your hand and I will ask you to speak by naming your call sign

4. This meeting will be max 90 minutes, shorter if we finish early



I want to begin with two quotes that articulate what we're working to accomplish with project Opus:


First is from Ephesians 5:11 where Paul writes:

“Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them”


Second is a quote by Henry Ford who says:

“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.” 



Project Opus is about exposing the fraud of fiat currency and inciting revolution one person at a time by helping them understand truth

When enough Canadians understand the truth, opt out of fraudulent currency and commit to helping restore sound money in Canada, I think we will see meaningful change



Agenda today:

- 5 minutes opening the call
- 10 minutes reviewing changes since last meeting (website, podcast, hats)
- 70 minutes reviewing project Opus which is the focal topic of this meeting
- 5 minutes to close the meeting



1. Updates since last meeting:

- The website has been updated to include a button for the end inflation campaign. to access the repo, click on the orange maple leaf


- Orange podcast has 8 episodes recorded. It's a place for serious people to have thoughtful conversations about serious issues. Podcast has its own domain at canadianorangepodcast.com

Consider this an open invitation for anyone to submit a recorded conversation that we can post or to schedule a conversation with me

Again, the Canadian Orange podcast is a forum to have conversations about how restoring a sound money standard changes Canada

- Lastly, we officially have hats. Operator hat, Ranger hat. Explain Canadian Orange Ranger. why the name was chosen, picture of hat on nostr, if you want one, DM on nostr, i have a half dozen ready

The ranger hat is for anyone who wants to support the orange party. The credo of the canadian orange ranger is: Steward of truth, mentally & physically strong, advocate of sound money, defender of freedom.

If you want a ranger hat, you can email or DM on NOSTR. sats only, I can ship anywere in Canada. 

We also have an operator hat. These are for individuals who are highly involved with the orange party and taking on active duties in exposing the fraud of currency inflation



2. Project Opus

The objective with this project is to tell people the truth and tansmute anger into action

We're finalizing a paper pamphlet which will be printed and handed out in person

We're also finalizing a digital version which will be hosted on the website


The core flow of each option is essentially:

Page 1: You’re being stolen from, inflation is theft
Page 2: lies vs truth
Page 3: Comparison of fiat and sound money
Page 4: How to protect yourself (dedicated pages for studying money and saving in bitcoin. Practical primers - current live on pamphlet B)
Page 5: contact your politician with a letter template provided

Collect feedback until Jan 3 and print our first version of the pamphlet
