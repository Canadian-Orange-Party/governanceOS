Welcome to the first official meeting for the Canadian Orange Party

My call sign is Spear, orange ID CO_919953. I'm excited and honoured to be moderating this first meeting

Current block height is 921,627 and 1 canadian dollar currently buys you 647 satoshis, or sats for shott, which are fractions of a bitcoin

Today is a special day. 17 years ago today, Satoshi unveiled the Bitcoin whitepaper to the world. Great day to re-read the whitepaper every year, I plan to do that later today 

Thank you all for attending live and thank you to everyone reading this meeting transcript



A few housekeeping items to begin with:


1. This meeting is being recorded

The audio will be transcribed and made public online in the repository. For privacy and security reasons, please do not use your real name during meetings

If you haven't already, please choose a word from the BIP39 wordlist and use that as your indetifier for all meetings and also ideally on NOSTR to maintain consistency

Once transcribed, the transcript will be reviewed for accuracy with the recording and upon review completion, audio recordings will be deleted to prevent voice recognition doxxing our Orange ID 

We created an identification protocol which is available on the website

Before you speak, please identify yourself with your call sign 

This may seem extreme but we feel it’s critical for our individual privacy and safety

The fiat powers know no limits for how far they will go to silence truth or threats to its powers. It’s up to us to maintain privacy to protect ourselves long term.


2. Please keep your mic muted until you are ready to speak to reduce background noise

3. Please update your name to your call sign so others on the call know who is speaking

4. If you wish to speak, please raise your hand and I will ask you to speak by naming your call sign

5. This meeting will be max 90 minutes, shorter if we finish early


Agenda today:

- 5 minutes opening the call
- 10 minutes reviewing changes since lasr meeting (website, podcast)
- 45 minutes reviewing project Opus which is the focal topic of this meeting
- 15 minutes reviewing project Aurantium
- 5 minutes to close the meeting



1. Review changes since last meeting (website, podcast)

- The website has been updated and cleanup up
- On the main page we added a slightly modified version of John Diefenbakers speech from 1960. Calling it the orange pledge
- Pledge meaning a formal promise

It says:

I am Canadian

A free Canadian

Free to speak without fear

Free to worship God in my own way

Free to transact without censorship

Free to use sound money

Free to stand for what I think right

Free to oppose what I believe is wrong

Free to choose those who governs my country

This heritage of freedom I pledge to uphold for myself and all mankind


The Canadian Orange Podcast now has 3 episodes recorded I'm aware of a half dozen more already lined up by various canadians

The orange podcast is an audio forum for Canadians to have conversations about restoring freedom in Canada by restoring a sound money standard

Consider this an open invitation for anyone to record a conversation and submit it to the orange party

If it makes the cut, you get paid anywhere from 5,000 to 21,000 sats for the submission

If anyone is interested please email the orange party for selection criteria guidelines

If anyone wants to be interviewed, let me know and I can connect you with a partner to record with
