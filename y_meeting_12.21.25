Welcome to the third meeting for the Canadian Orange Party

My call sign is Spear, orange ID CO_919953. I'm honoured to be moderating this session

Current block height is [X] and 1 canadian dollar currently buys you [X] sats

Thank you all for attending live and thank you to everyone reading this meeting transcript



A few housekeeping items to begin with:


1. This meeting is being recorded

The audio will be transcribed and made public online in the repository. For privacy and security reasons, please do not use your real name during meetings

If you haven't already, please choose a word from the BIP39 wordlist and use that as your indetifier for all meetings and also ideally on NOSTR to maintain consistency

Once transcribed, the transcript will be reviewed for accuracy with the recording and upon review completion, audio recordings will be deleted to prevent voice recognition doxxing our Orange ID 

We created an identification protocol which is available on the website

Before you speak, please identify yourself with your call sign 

This may seem extreme but we feel it’s critical for our individual privacy and safety

The fiat powers know no limits for how far they will go to silence truth or threats to its powers. It’s up to us to maintain privacy to protect ourselves long term.


2. Please keep your mic muted until you are ready to speak to reduce background noise

3. Please update your name to your call sign so others on the call know who is speaking

4. If you wish to speak, please raise your hand and I will ask you to speak by naming your call sign

5. This meeting will be max 90 minutes, shorter if we finish early



Fiat currency is a deceitful scheme designed to exploit citizens. It is a normalized fraud that enables systemic theft through an accelerating shadow tax of currency inflation.

Canada was once on a sound money standard and we must return to it in order to restore civility, truth and freedom. 

We must all be part of the action and we need your help. Share this resource and contact your politician to voice your anger about the fraud of inflation

Ephesians 5:11

“Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them”
