To my fellow Canadian citizens

As a Canadian with young children, I'm concerned about the state of our country, the trajectory we are on and I'm angry

I'm recording this monologue to share a perspective and as a call to action to anyone out there who is fed up and ready to take action so we can restore freedom, truth and justice within Canada

If this resonates with you, please share it and if you want to get involved, email canadianorangeparty@protonmail.com

Thank you for being here and listening to this.

Our country is not doing well

Our people are sick and the corrupt politicians are eroding our freedoms at an unprecendented rate

Society is degrading all around us and it's becoming impossible to ignore

Life is becoming unaffordable, addiction is rampant and our hospital system is collapsing 

Our quality of life, our safety and the wealth of our nation are being vaporized in front of our eyes

State funded propaganda feeds Canadians a constant flurry of lies

Politicians claiming to serve citizens are looting our country while many stand by watching

The root cause of the corruption, disease and slavery is broken money

While you may accept canadian dollars as a valid and useful form of money, the reality is that our national currency is a fraudulent, manipulated currency designed to steal and extort Canadian citizens

We're told that inflation is a required, normal phenomenon of prices steadily increasing 2-3% per year but this is a blatant lie

We're told that corporate greed causes inflation

We're told that Trumps tariffs are causing inflation 

We're told that CPI is 2-3% per year

These are are lies designed to manipulate us and distract us from the core truth that inflation is really just the intentional manipulation and devaluation of our currency

That devaluation benefits a select few while punishing the many who see their purchasing power erode in the form of higher prices







If you're tired of fraudulent currency stealing your time

If you're concerned about the erosion of your freedoms

If you're frustrated watching the Canadian government waste money and squadering Canada's wealth

Then this was recorded for you


I'm not here to tell you everyuthing is going to be fine because frankly, it might not be

Things will probably get worse. Our corrupt politicians will promise things and tell us that giving up freedoms will allow them to make changes for all of our benefit

Don't believe the liars. Don't fall for their tricks

If we want things to improve, we need to act like it. We need to take responsibility and reclaim agency

If we want to protect our livelihood and our children, we need to coordinate and take action and we need to do it now

We are on the ledge of losing freedom in Canada forever. Once it's gone, it will likely never come back

This is an existential moment for Canada. This is a critical moment for you to preserve freedom and truth for your children


Many things are deeply broken but the root cause is singular: fraudulent money

Fixing the money is the primary battefront in the war of citizens vs banking overlords masquerading as politicians






The Candian Orange Party is a movement by Canadians to fix the money so we can fix our country


Einstein said:

"The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything"


To modify Einsteins words to fit our current predicament:

Canada won't be destroyed by politicians, but by Canaddians who watch them destroy and enslave the country without doing anything

I'm writing this leter because I refuse to watch time thieves loot and control Canadians while doing nothing to stop it


By controlling and manipulating the Canadian currency, unelected bankers have gained control of our country and are eroding our quality of life and freedoms

If nothing changes, a dark, dystopian Canada is approaching very fast and our generation risks going down in history as the last one that had freedoms and privacy

Will you allow that to happen under your watch?

We didn't create the mess but it's our responsibility to end the corruption and restore society for future generations

We're doing this to protect our families and leave our children a safe, healthy and wealthy Canada

We refuse to run away or stand by and allow Canadian freedoms to be taken away by fiat scum

Canada is a majestic land with abundant resouces

Canadians are mostly kind, considerate, resilient people

Under a sound money standard and with competent leadership, Canada will be one of the wealthiest nations on earth

If you are someone who sees politics as the make believe theatre that it has become, you may have opted out of the political theatre

The problem with that is that if good people opt out of the political process, we leave an opportunity for unscrupulous, incompetent individuals to insert themselves and eventually affect how we live

To fix this mess we need to focus our energy on the root cause problem: broken money

Broken money directly causes inflation

Broken money incentivizes government waste

Broken money creates massive suffering

Broken money leads to rampant waste and consumerism

We vow to fix the money so we can fix Canada

We are ushering in a mass return of civic engagement

A culture of engaging our representatives and informing them about the problem of broken money



Most Canadians seem to have two choices:

If you still have faith in politics, you can vote red or blue

If you've lost faith in politics, you can exit or insulate 


Those who still have faith in politics don't yet understand that red or blue is really the illusion of choice because neither team addresses the root problem of broken money 

If you've lost faith in politics, you can exit the country for the sake of your health and quality of life or protect yourself from the increasing chaos created by broken money

If you care about your friends and family, exit and insulate are both negative options because your friends and family will suffer from the increasing chaos and damage caused by broken money


I’m writing this letter to tell you that as of September 23, 2025 there is a third option called the Canadian Orange Party

Orange is the colour of sound money, freedom and abundance

We unify and coordinate to solve the single, largest problem Canada faces today: broken money

To be specific, The Canadian Orange Party focuses on the singular political mandate of ending currency inflation
